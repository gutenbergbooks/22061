<h3>SATURDAY EVENING'S WORK.</h3>


<p>Down in a little hollow, with the sides
grown full of wild thorn, alder bushes, and
stunted cedars, ran the stream of a clear
spring. It ran over a bed of pebbly stones,
showing every one as if there had been no
water there, so clear it was; and it ran with
a sweet soft murmur or gurgle over the stones,
as if singing to itself and the bushes as it ran.</p>

<p>On one side of the little stream a worn
foot path took its course among the bushes;
and down this path one summer's afternoon
came a woman and a girl. They had pails
to fill at the spring; the woman had a large
wooden one, and the girl a light tin pail;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and they drew the water with a little tin
dipper, for it was not deep enough to let a
pail be used for that. The pails were filled
in silence, only the spring always was singing;
and the woman and the girl turned and went
up the path again. After getting up the
bank, which was only a few feet, the path
still went gently rising through a wild bit of
ground, full of trees and low bushes; and
not far off, through the trees, there came a
gleam of bright light from the window of a
house, on which the setting sun was shining.
Half way to the house the girl and the woman
stopped to rest; for water is heavy, and the
tin pail which was so light before it was
filled, had made the little girl's figure bend
over to one side like a willow branch all the
way from the spring. They stopped to rest,
and even the woman had a very weary, jaded
look.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I shall give up, some of these
days," she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"O no, mother!" the little girl answered,
cheerfully. She was panting, with her hand
on her side, and her face had a quiet, very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
sober look; only at those words a little pleasant
smile broke over it.</p>

<p>"I shall," said the woman. "One can't
stand everything,&mdash;for ever."</p>

<p>The little girl had not got over panting
yet, but standing there she struck up the
sweet air and words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'There is rest for the weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There is rest for the weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There is rest for the weary,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There is rest for you.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yes, in the grave!" said the woman, bitterly.
"There's no rest short of that,&mdash;for
mind or body."</p>

<p>"O yes, mother dear. 'For we which have
believed do enter into rest.' Jesus don't
make us wait."</p>

<p>"I believe you eat the Bible and sleep on
the Bible," said the woman, with a faint
smile, taking at the same time a corner of
her apron to wipe away a stray tear which
had gathered in her eye. "I am glad it rests
you, Nettie."</p>

<p>"And you, mother."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," Mrs. Mathieson answered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
with a sigh. "But there's your father going
to bring home a boarder, Nettie."</p>

<p>"A boarder, mother!&mdash;What for?"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows!&mdash;if it isn't to break my
back, and my heart together. I thought I
had enough to manage before, but here's this
man coming, and I've got to get everything
ready for him by to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"Who is it, mother?"</p>

<p>"It's one of your father's friends; so it's
no good," said Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"But where can he sleep?" Nettie asked,
after a moment of thinking. Her mother
paused.</p>

<p>"There's no room but yours he can have.
Barry wont be moved."</p>

<p>"Where shall I sleep, mother?"</p>

<p>"There's no place but up in the attic. I'll
see what I can do to fit up a corner for you&mdash;if
I ever can get time," said Mrs. Mathieson,
taking up her pail. Nettie followed her
example, and certainly did not smile again
till they reached the house. They went
round to the front door, because the back
door belonged to another family. At the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
door, as they set down their pails again before
mounting the stairs, Nettie smiled at her
mother very placidly, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't you go to fit up the attic, mother;
I'll see to it in time. I can do it just as well."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson made no answer but
groaned internally, and they went up the
flight of stairs which led to their part of the
house. The ground floor was occupied by
somebody else. A little entry way at the
top of the stairs received the wooden pail of
water, and with the tin one Nettie went into
the room used by the family. It was her
father and mother's sleeping-room, their bed
standing in one corner. It was the kitchen
apparently, for a small cooking-stove was
there, on which Nettie put the tea-kettle
when she had filled it. And it was the
common living-room also; for the next thing
she did was to open a cupboard and take out
cups and saucers and arrange them on a leaf
table which stood toward one end of the
room. The furniture was wooden and plain;
the woodwork of the windows was unpainted;
the cups and plates were of the commonest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
kind; and the floor had no covering but two
strips of rag carpeting; nevertheless the
whole was tidy and very clean, showing
constant care. Mrs. Mathieson had sunk
into a chair, as one who had no spirit to do
anything; and watched her little daughter
setting the table with eyes which seemed not
to see her. They gazed inwardly at something
she was thinking of.</p>

<p>"Mother, what is there for supper?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing. I must make some
porridge." And Mrs. Mathieson got up from
her chair.</p>

<p>"Sit you still, mother, and I'll make it. I
can."</p>

<p>"If both our backs are to be broken," said
Mrs. Mathieson, "I'd rather mine would
break first." And she went on with her preparations.</p>

<p>"But you don't like porridge," said Nettie.
"You didn't eat anything last night."</p>

<p>"That's nothing, child. I can bear an
empty stomach, if only my brain wasn't quite
so full."</p>

<p>Nettie drew near the stove and looked on,
a little sorrowfully.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
"I wish you had something you liked,
mother! If only I was a little older, wouldn't
it be nice? I could earn something then,
and I would bring you home things that you
liked out of my own money."</p>

<p>This was not said sorrowfully, but with a
bright gleam as of some fancied and pleasant
possibility. The gleam was so catching, Mrs.
Mathieson turned from her porridge-pot
which she was stirring, to give a very heartfelt
kiss to Nettie's lips; then she stirred on,
and the shadow came over her face again.</p>

<p>"Dear," she said, "just go in Barry's room
and straighten it up a little before he comes
in&mdash;will you? I haven't had a minute to do
it, all day; and there wont be a bit of peace
if he comes in and it isn't in order."</p>

<p>Nettie turned and opened another door,
which let her into a small chamber used as
somebody's bedroom. It was all brown, like
the other; a strip of the same carpet in the
middle of the floor, and a small cheap chest
of drawers, and a table. The bed had not
been made up, and the tossed condition of the
bedclothes spoke for the strength and energy
of the person that used them, whoever he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
was. A pair of coarse shoes were in the
middle of the whole; another pair, or rather
a pair of half-boots, out at the toes, were in
the middle of the floor; stockings, one under
the bed and one under the table. On the
table was a heap of confusion; and on the
little bureau were to be seen pieces of wood,
half cut and uncut, with shavings, and the
knife and saw that had made them. Old
newspapers, and school books, and a slate,
and two kites, with no end of tail, were lying
over every part of the room that happened
to be convenient; also an ink bottle and
pens; with chalk and resin and a medley of
unimaginable things beside, that only boys
can collect together and find delight in. If
Nettie sighed as all this hurly-burly met her
eye, it was only an internal sigh. She set
about patiently bringing things to order.
First made the bed, which it took all her
strength to do: for the coverlets were of a
very heavy and coarse manufacture of cotton
and woollen mixed, blue and white; and
then gradually found a way to bestow the
various articles in Barry's apartment, so that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
things looked neat and comfortable. But
perhaps it was a little bit of a sign of
Nettie's feeling, that she began softly to sing
to herself,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'There is rest for the weary.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Hollo!" burst in a rude boy of some
fifteen years, opening the door from the
entry,&mdash;"who's puttin' my room to rights?"</p>

<p>A very gentle voice said, "I've done it,
Barry."</p>

<p>"What have you done with that pine log?"</p>

<p>"Here it is,&mdash;in the corner behind the
bureau."</p>

<p>"Don't you touch it now, to take it for
your fire,&mdash;mind, Nettie! Where's my
kite?"</p>

<p>"You wont have time to fly it now, Barry;
supper will be ready in two minutes."</p>

<p>"What you got?"</p>

<p>"The same kind we had last night."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't care for supper." Barry was
getting the tail of his kite together.</p>

<p>"But please, Barry, come now; because it
will make mother so much more trouble if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
you don't. She has the things to clear away
after you're done, you know!"</p>

<p>"Trouble! so much talk about trouble! <em>I</em>
don't mind trouble. I don't want any supper,
I tell you."</p>

<p>Nettie knew well enough he would want it
by and by, but there was no use in saying
anything more, and she said nothing. Barry
got his kite together and went off. Then
came a heavier step on the stairs, which she
knew; and she hastily went into the other
room to see that all was ready. The tea was
made, and Mrs. Mathieson put the smoking
dish of porridge on the table, just as the door
opened and a man came in. A tall, burly,
strong man, with a face that would have been
a good face enough if its expression had been
different, and if its hue had not been that of
a purplish-red flush. He came to the table
and silently sat down as he took a survey of
what was on it.</p>

<p>"Give me a cup of tea! Have you got no
bread, Sophia?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but what you see. I hoped you
would bring home some money, Mr. Mathieson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
I have neither milk nor bread; it's a
mercy there's sugar. I don't know what you
expect a lodger to live on."</p>

<p>"Live on his board,&mdash;that'll give you
enough. But you want something to begin
with. I'd go out and get one or two things&mdash;but
I'm so confounded tired. I can't."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson, without a word, put on a
shawl and went to the closet for her bonnet.</p>

<p>"I'll go, mother! Let me go, please. I
want to go," exclaimed Nettie, eagerly. "I
can get it. What shall I get, father?"</p>

<p>Slowly and weariedly the mother laid off
her things, as quickly the child put hers on.</p>

<p>"What shall I get, father?"</p>

<p>"Well, you can go down the street to
Jackson's, and get what your mother wants:
some milk and bread; and then you'd better
fetch seven pounds of meal and a quart
of treacle. And ask him to give you a nice
piece of pork out of his barrel."</p>

<p>"She can't bring all that!" exclaimed the
mother; "you'd better go yourself, Mr.
Mathieson. That would be a great deal more
than the child can carry, or I either."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
"Then I'll go twice, mother; it isn't far;
I'd like to go. I'll get it. Please give me
the money, father."</p>

<p>He cursed and swore at her, for answer.
"Go along, and do as you are bid, without
all this chaffering! Go to Jackson's and tell
him you want the things, and I'll give him
the money to-morrow. He knows me."</p>

<p>Nettie knew he did, and stood her ground.
Her father was just enough in liquor to be a
little thick-headed and foolish.</p>

<p>"You know I can't go without the money,
father," she said, gently; "and to-morrow is
Sunday."</p>

<p>He cursed Sunday and swore again, but
finally put his hand in his pocket and threw
some money across the table to her. He was
just in a state not to be careful what he did,
and he threw her crown-pieces where if he
had been quite himself he would have given
shillings. Nettie took them without any remark,
and her basket, and went out.</p>

<p>It was just sundown. The village lay glittering
in the light, that would be gone in a
few minutes; and up on the hill the white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
church, standing high, showed all bright in
the sunbeams from its sparkling vane at the
top of the spire down to the lowest step at
the door. Nettie's home was in a branch-road,
a few steps from the main street of the
village that led up to the church at one end
of it. All along that street the sunlight lay,
on the grass and the roadway and the sidewalks
and the tops of a few elm-trees. The
street was empty; it was most people's
supper-time. Nettie turned the corner and
went down the village. She went slowly;
her little feet were already tired with the
work they had done that day, and back and
arms and head all seemed tired too. But
Nettie never thought it hard that her mother
did not go instead of letting her go; she
knew her mother could not bear to be seen
in the village in the old shabby gown and
shawl she wore; for Mrs. Mathieson had seen
better days. And besides that, she would be
busy enough as it was, and till a late hour,
this Saturday night. Nettie's gown was
shabby too; yes, very, compared with that
almost every other child in the village wore;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
yet somehow Nettie was not ashamed. She
did not think of it now, as her slow steps took
her down the village street; she was thinking
what she should do about the money. Her
father had given her two or three times as
much, she knew, as he meant her to spend;
he was a good workman, and had just got in
his week's wages. What should Nettie do?
Might she keep and give to her mother what
was over? it was, and would be, so much
wanted! and from her father they could
never get it again. He had his own ways of
disposing of what he earned, and very little
of it indeed went to the wants of his wife and
daughter. What might Nettie do? She
pondered, swinging her basket in her hand,
till she reached a corner where the village
street turned off again, and where the store
of Mr. Jackson stood. There she found
Barry bargaining for some things he at least
had money for.</p>

<p>"O Barry, how good!" exclaimed Nettie;
"you can help me carry my things home."</p>

<p>"I'll know the reason first, though," answered
Barry. "What are you going to
get?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
"Father wants a bag of corn meal and a
piece of pork and some treacle; and you
know I can't carry them all, Barry. I've
got to get bread and milk besides."</p>

<p>"Hurra!" said Barry, "now we'll have
fried cakes! I'll tell you what I'll do, Nettie&mdash;I'll
take home the treacle, if you'll make
me some to-night for supper."</p>

<p>"O I can't, Barry! I've got so much else
to do, and it's Saturday night."</p>

<p>"Very good&mdash;get your things home yourself
then."</p>

<p>Barry turned away, and Nettie made her
bargains. He still stood by however and
watched her. When the pork and the meal
and the treacle were bestowed in the basket,
it was so heavy she could not manage to
carry it. How many journeys to and fro
would it cost her?</p>

<p>"Barry," she said, "you take this home
for me, and if mother says so, I'll make you
the cakes."</p>

<p>"Be quick then," said her brother,
shouldering the basket, "for I'm getting
hungry."</p>

<p>Nettie went a few steps further on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
main road of the village, which was little
besides one long street and not very long
either; and went in at the door of a very
little dwelling, neat and tidy like all the rest.
It admitted her to the tiniest morsel of a
shop&mdash;at least there was a long table there
which seemed to do duty as a counter; and
before, not behind, it sat a spruce little woman
sewing. She jumped up as Nettie entered.
By the becoming smartness of her calico
dress and white collar, the beautiful order of
her hair, and a certain peculiarity of feature,
you might know before she spoke that the
little baker was a Frenchwoman. She spoke
English quite well, though not so fast as she
spoke her own tongue.</p>

<p>"I want two loaves of bread, Mrs. August;
and a pint of milk, if you please."</p>

<p>"How will you carry them, my child? you
cannot take them all at the time."</p>

<p>"O yes, I can," said Nettie, cheerfully. "I
can manage. They are not heavy."</p>

<p>"No, I hope not," said the Frenchwoman;
"it is not heavy, my bread! but two loaves
are not one, no more. Is your mother well?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
She then set busily about wrapping the
loaves in paper and measuring out the milk.
Nettie answered her mother was well.</p>

<p>"And you?" said the little woman, looking
at her sideways. "Somebody is tired this
evening."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Nettie, brightly; "but I don't
mind. One must be tired sometimes. Thank
you, ma'am."</p>

<p>The woman had put the loaves and the
milk carefully in her arms and in her hand,
so that she could carry them, and looked
after her as she went up the street.</p>

<p>"One must be tired sometimes!" said she
to herself, with a turn of her capable little
head. "I should like to hear her say 'One
must be rested sometimes;' but I do not
hear that."</p>

<p>So perhaps Nettie thought, as she went
homeward. It would have been very natural.
Now the sun was down, the bright gleam
was off the village; the soft shades of evening
were gathering and lights twinkled in windows.
Nettie walked very slowly, her arms full of
the bread. Perhaps she wished her Saturday's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
work was all done, like other people's.
All I can tell you is, that as she went along
through the quiet deserted street, all alone,
she broke out softly singing to herself the
words,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No need of the sun in that day<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">Which never is followed by night."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And that when she got home she ran up
stairs quite briskly, and came in with a very
placid face; and told her mother she had
had a pleasant walk&mdash;which was perfectly
true.</p>

<p>"I'm glad, dear," said her mother, with a
sigh. "What made it pleasant?"</p>

<p>"Why, mother," said Nettie, "Jesus was
with me all the way."</p>

<p>"God bless you, child!" said her mother;
"you are the very rose of my heart!"</p>

<p>There was only time for this little dialogue,
for which Mr. Mathieson's slumbers had
given a chance. But then Barry entered,
and noisily claimed Nettie's promise. And
without a cloud crossing her sweet brow, she
made the cakes, and baked them on the
stove, and served Barry until he had enough;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
nor ever said how weary she was of being on
her feet. There were some cakes left, and
Mrs. Mathieson saw to it that Nettie sat down
and ate them; and then sent her off to bed
without suffering her to do anything more;
though Nettie pleaded to be allowed to clear
away the dishes. Mrs. Mathieson did that;
and then sat down to make darns and patches
on various articles of clothing, till the old
clock of the church on the hill tolled out
solemnly the hour of twelve all over the
village.</p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<h3>SUNDAY'S REST.</h3>


<p>Nettie's room was the only room on
that floor besides her mother's and Barry's.
It was at the back of the house, with a
pleasant look-out over the trees and bushes
between it and the spring. Over these the
view went to distant hills and fields, that
always looked pretty in all sorts of lights,
Nettie thought. Besides that, it was a clean,
neat little room; bare to be sure, without
even Barry's strip of rag carpet; but on a
little black table lay Nettie's Bible and
Sunday-school books; and each window had
a chair; and a chest of drawers held all her
little wardrobe and a great deal of room to
spare besides; and the cot-bed in one corner
was nicely made up. It was a very comfortable-looking
room to Nettie.</p>

<p>"So this is the last night I shall sleep
here!" she thought as she went in. "To-morrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
I must go up to the attic. Well,&mdash;I
can pray there just the same; and God
will be with me there just the same."</p>

<p>It was a comfort; but it was the only one
Nettie could think of in connexion with her
removal. The attic was no room, but only
a little garret used as a lumber place; not
boarded up, nor plastered at all; nothing
but the beams and the side-boarding for the
walls, and nothing but the rafters and the
shingles between it and the sky. Besides
which, it was full of lumber of one sort and
another. How Nettie was to move up there
the next day, being Sunday, she could not
imagine; but she was so tired that as soon
as her head touched her pillow she fell fast
asleep, and forgot to think about it.</p>

<p>The next thing was the bright morning
light rousing her, and the joyful thought that
it was Sunday morning. A beautiful day it
was. The eastern light was shining over
upon Nettie's distant hills, with all sorts of
fresh lovely colours and promise of what the
coming hours would bring. Nettie looked
at them lovingly, for she was very fond of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
them and had a great many thoughts about
those hills. "As the mountains are round
about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about
his people;"&mdash;that was one thing they made
her think of. She thought of it now as she
was dressing, and it gave her the feeling of
being surrounded with a mighty and strong
protection on every side. It made Nettie's
heart curiously glad, and her tongue speak of
joyful things; for when she knelt down to
pray she was full of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The next thing was, that taking her tin
pail Nettie set off down to the spring to get
water to boil the kettle. It was so sweet
and pleasant&mdash;no other spring could supply
nicer water. The dew brushed from the
bushes and grass as she went by; and from
every green thing there went up a fresh
dewy smell that was reviving. The breath
of the summer wind, moving gently, touched
her cheek and fluttered her hair, and said
God had given a beautiful day to the world;
and Nettie thanked him in her heart and
went on rejoicing. Sunday was Nettie's
holiday, and Sunday-school and church were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
her delight. And though she went in all
weathers, and nothing would keep her, yet
sunshine is sunshine; and she felt so this
morning. So she gaily filled her pail at the
spring and trudged back with it to the house.
The next thing was to tap at her mother's
door.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson opened it, in her nightgown;
she was just up, and looked as if her
night's sleep had been all too short for her.</p>

<p>"Why, Nettie!&mdash;is it late?" she said, as
Nettie and the tin pail came in.</p>

<p>"No, mother; it's just good time. You
get dressed, and I'll make the fire ready.
It's beautiful out, mother."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson made no answer, and
Nettie went to work with the fire. It was
an easy matter to put in some paper and
kindle the light wood; and when the kettle
was on, Nettie went round the room softly
setting it to rights as well as she could. Then
glanced at her father, still sleeping.</p>

<p>"I can't set the table yet, mother."</p>

<p>"No, child; go off, and I'll see to the rest.
If I can get folks up, at least," said Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Mathieson, somewhat despondingly. Sunday
morning that was a doubtful business, she
and Nettie knew. Nettie went to her own
room to carry out a plan she had. If she
could manage to get her things conveyed up
to the attic without her mother knowing it,
just so much labour and trouble would be
spared her, and her mother might have a
better chance of some rest that day. Little
enough, with a lodger coming that evening!
To get her things up there,&mdash;that was all
Nettie would do to-day; but that must be
done. The steep stairs to the attic went up
from the entry way, just outside of Nettie's
door. She went up the first time to see
what place there was to bestow anything.</p>

<p>The little garret was strewn all over with
things carelessly thrown in, merely to get
them out of the way. There was a small
shutter window in each gable. One was
open, just revealing the utter confusion; but
half-showing the dust that lay on everything.
The other window, the back one, was fairly
shut up by a great heap of boxes and barrels
piled against it. In no part was there a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
clear space, or a hopeful opening. Nettie
stood aghast for some moments, not knowing
what to do. "But if I don't, mother will
have to," she thought. It nerved her little
arm, and one thought of her invisible protection
nerved her heart, which had sunk at
first coming up. Softly she moved and began
her operations, lest her mother down stairs
should hear and find out what she was about
before it was done. Sunday too! But there
was no help for it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the pile of boxes, she
resolved to begin at the end with the closed
window; for near the other there were things
she could not move: an old stove, a wheelbarrow,
a box of heavy iron tools, and some
bags of charcoal and other matters. By a
little pushing and coaxing, Nettie made a
place for the boxes, and then began her task
of removing them. One by one, painfully,
for some were unwieldy and some were
weighty, they travelled across in Nettie's
arms, or were shoved, or turned over and
over across the floor, from the window to a
snug position under the eaves where she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
stowed them. Barry would have been a
good hand at this business, not to speak of
his father: but Nettie knew there was no
help to be had from either of them; and the
very thought of them did not come into her
head. Mr. Mathieson, provided he worked
at his trade, thought the "women-folks"
might look after the house; Barry considered
that when he had got through the heavy
labours of school, he had done his part of the
world's work. So Nettie toiled on with her
boxes and barrels. They scratched her arms;
they covered her clean face with dust; they
tried her strength; but every effort saved
one to her mother, and Nettie never stopped
except to gather breath and rest.</p>

<p>The last thing of all under the window
was a great old chest. Nettie could not
move it, and she concluded it might stay
there very conveniently for a seat. All the
rest of the pile she cleared away, and then
opened the window. There was no sash;
nothing but a wooden shutter fastened with
a hook. Nettie threw it open. There, to
her great joy, behold she had the very same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
view of her hills, all shining in the sun now.
Only this window was higher than her old
one, and lifted her up more above the tops of
the trees, and gave a better and clearer and
wider view of the distant open country she
liked so much. Nettie was greatly delighted,
and refreshed herself with a good look out
and a breath of fresh air before she began
her labours again. That gave the dust a
little chance to settle, too.</p>

<p>There was a good deal to do yet before
she could have a place clear for her bed, not
to speak of anything more. However, it was
done at last; the floor brushed up, all ready,
and the top of the chest wiped clean; and
next Nettie set about bringing all her things
up the stairs and setting them here, where
she could. Her clothes, her little bit of a
looking-glass, her Bible and books and slate,
even her little washstand, she managed to
lug up to the attic; with many a journey and
much pains. But it was about done, before
her mother called her to breakfast. The
two lagging members of the family had been
roused at last, and were seated at the table.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
"Why, what have you been doing, child?
how you look!" said Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"How do I look?" said Nettie.</p>

<p>"Queer enough," said her father.</p>

<p>Nettie laughed, and hastened to another
subject; she knew if they got upon this
there would be some disagreeable words
before it was over. She had made up her
mind what to do, and now handed her father
the money remaining from her purchases.
"You gave me too much, father, last night,"
she said, simply; "here is the rest." Mr.
Mathieson took it and looked at it.</p>

<p>"Did I give you all this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>"Did you pay for what you got, besides?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He muttered something which was very
like an oath in his throat, and looked at his
little daughter, who was quietly eating her
breakfast. Something touched him unwontedly.</p>

<p>"You're an honest little girl!" he said.
"There! you may have that for yourself;"
and he tossed her a shilling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
You could see, by a little streak of pink
colour down each of Nettie's cheeks, that
some great thought of pleasure had started
into her mind. "For myself, father?" she
repeated.</p>

<p>"All for yourself," said Mr. Mathieson,
buttoning up his money with a very satisfied
air. Nettie said no more, only ate her
breakfast a little quicker after that. It was
time, too; for the late hours of some of the
family always made her in a hurry about
getting to Sunday-school; and the minute
Nettie had done, she got her bonnet, her
Sunday bonnet&mdash;the best she had to wear&mdash;and
set off. Mrs. Mathieson never let her
wait for anything at home <em>that</em> morning.</p>

<p>This was Nettie's happy time. It never
troubled her, that she had nothing but a sun-bonnet
of white muslin, nicely starched and
ironed, while almost all the other girls that
came to the school had little straw bonnets
trimmed with blue and pink and yellow and
green ribbons; and some of them wore silk
bonnets. Nettie did not even think of it; she
loved her Sunday lesson, and her Bible, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
her teacher, so much; and it was such a good
time when she went to enjoy them all together.
There was only a little way she had
to go; for the road where Mrs. Mathieson
lived, after running down a little further from
the village, met another road which turned
right up the hill to the church; or Nettie
could take the other way, to the main village
street, and straight up that. Generally she
chose the forked way, because it was the
emptiest.</p>

<p>Nettie's class in the Sunday-school was of
ten little girls about her own age; and their
teacher was a very pleasant and kind gentleman,
named Mr. Folke. Nettie loved him
dearly; she would do anything that Mr.
Folke told her to do. Their teacher was
very apt to give the children a question to
answer from the Bible; for which they had
to look out texts during the week. This
week the question was, "Who are happy?"
and Nettie was very eager to know what
answers the other girls would bring. She
was in good time, and sat resting and
watching the boys and girls and teachers as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
they came in, before the school began. She
was first there of all her class; and watching
so eagerly to see those who were coming, that
she did not know Mr. Folke was near till he
spoke to her. Nettie started and turned.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said her teacher,
kindly. "Are you quite well, Nettie, this
morning?" For he thought she looked pale
and tired. But her face coloured with
pleasure and a smile shone all over it, as she
told him she was very well.</p>

<p>"Have you found out who are the happy
people, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Folke; I have found a verse.
But I knew before."</p>

<p>"I thought you did. Who are they,
Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Those that love Jesus, sir."</p>

<p>"Ay. In the Christian armour, you know,
the feet are 'shod with the preparation of the
Gospel of peace.' With the love of Jesus in
our hearts, our feet can go over very rough
ways and hardly feel that they are rough.
Do you find it so?"</p>

<p>"O yes, sir!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
He said no more, for others of the class
now came up; and Nettie wondered how he
knew, or if he knew, that she had a rough
way to go over. But his words were a help
and comfort to her. So was the whole
lesson that day. The verses about the
happy people were beautiful. The seven
girls who sat on one side of Nettie repeated
the blessings told of in the fifth chapter of
Matthew, about the poor in spirit, the
mourners, the meek, those that hunger and
thirst after righteousness, the merciful, the
pure in heart, and the peacemakers. Then
came Nettie's verse. It was this:</p>

<p>"Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob
for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his
God."</p>

<p>The next girl gave the words of Jesus, "If
ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do
them."</p>

<p>The last gave, "Blessed is he whose transgression
is forgiven, whose sin is covered."</p>

<p>Then came Mr. Folke's verse, and Nettie
thought it was the most beautiful of all.
"Blessed are they that do his commandments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
that they may have right to the tree
of life, and may enter in through the gates
into the city."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Folke talked about that city;
its streets of gold, and the gates of pearl,
through which nothing that defileth can by
any means enter. He told how Jesus will
make his people happy there; how they will
be with him, and all their tears wiped away.
And Jesus will be their Shepherd; his sheep
will not wander from him anymore; "and
they shall see his face, and his name shall be
in their foreheads." Nettie could hardly
keep from crying as Mr. Folke went on; she
felt as if she was half in heaven already, and
it seemed very odd to cry for gladness; but
she could not help it. Then the school
closed with singing the hymn,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O how happy are they<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">Who the Saviour obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">And have laid up their treasures above."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From school they went to church, of course.
A strange minister preached that day, and
Nettie could not understand him always;
but the words of the hymn and Mr. Folke's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
words ran in her head then, and she was
very happy all church time. And as she was
walking home, still the tune and the words
ran in her ears,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jesus all the day long<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">Is my joy and my song;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O that all his salvation might see!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So, thinking busily, Nettie got home and
ran up stairs. What a change! It looked
like a place very, very far from those gates of
pearl.</p>

<p>Her mother sat on one side of the stove,
not dressed for church, and leaning her head
on her hand. Mr. Mathieson was on the
other side, talking and angry. Barry stood
back, playing ball by himself by throwing it
up and catching it again. The talk stopped
at Nettie's entrance. She threw off her
bonnet and began to set the table, hoping
that would bring peace.</p>

<p>"Your father don't want any dinner," said
Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"Yes I do!"&mdash;thundered her husband;
"but I tell you I'll take anything now; so
leave your cooking till supper&mdash;when Lumber<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
will be here. Go on, child! and get your
work done."</p>

<p>There were no preparations for dinner,
and Nettie was at a loss; and did not like to
say anything for fear of bringing on a storm.
Her mother looked both weary and out of
temper. The kettle was boiling,&mdash;the only
thing about the room that had a pleasant
seeming.</p>

<p>"Will you have a cup of tea, father?" said
Nettie.</p>

<p>"Anything you like&mdash;yes, a cup of tea
will do; and hark'ye, child, I want a good
stout supper got this afternoon. Your mother
don't choose to hear me. Mr. Lumber is
coming, and I want a good supper to make
him think he's got to the right place. Do
you hear, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>Nettie went on to do the best she could.
She warmed the remains of last night's
porridge and gave it to Barry with treacle,
to keep him quiet. Meanwhile she had
made the tea, and toasted a slice of bread
very nicely, though with great pains, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
fire wasn't good; and the toast and a cup of
tea she gave to her father. He eat it with
an eagerness which let Nettie know she must
make another slice as fast as possible.</p>

<p>"Hollo! Nettie&mdash;I say, give us some of
that, will you?" said Barry, finding his
porridge poor in taste.</p>

<p>"Barry, there isn't bread enough&mdash;I can't,"
whispered Nettie. "We've got to keep a
loaf for supper."</p>

<p>"Eat what you've got, or let it alone!"
thundered Mr. Mathieson, in the way he had
when he was out of patience, and which
always tried Nettie exceedingly.</p>

<p>"She's got more," said Barry. "She's
toasting two pieces this minute. I want
one."</p>

<p>"I'll knock you over, if you say another
word," said his father. Nettie was frightened,
for she saw he meant to have the whole,
and she had destined a bit for her mother.
However, when she gave her father his second
slice, she ventured, and took the other with
a cup of tea to the forlorn figure on the other
side of the stove. Mrs. Mathieson took only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the tea. But Mr. Mathieson's ire was roused
afresh. Perhaps toast and tea didn't agree
with him.</p>

<p>"Have you got all ready for Mr. Lumber?"
he said, in a tone of voice very unwilling to
be pleased.</p>

<p>"No," said his wife,&mdash;"I have had no
chance. I have been cooking and clearing
up all the morning. His room isn't ready."</p>

<p>"Well, you had better get it ready pretty
quick. What's to do?"</p>

<p>"Everything's to do," said Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>He swore at her. "Why can't you answer
a plain question? I say, <em>what's</em> to do?"</p>

<p>"There's all Nettie's things in the room
at present. They are all to move up stairs,
and the red bedstead to bring down."</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Nettie, gently,&mdash;"all
my things are up stairs already;&mdash;there's only
the cot and the bed, that I couldn't move."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson gave no outward sign of
the mixed feeling of pain and pleasure that
shot through her heart. Pleasure at her
child's thoughtful love, pain that she should
have to show it in such a way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
"When did you do it, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"This morning before breakfast, mother.
It's all ready, father, if you or Barry would
take up my cot and the bed, and bring down
the other bedstead. It's too heavy for me."</p>

<p>"That's what I call doing business and
having some spirit," said her father. "Not
sitting and letting your work come to you.
Here, Nettie&mdash;I'll do the rest for you."</p>

<p>Nettie ran with him to show him what
was wanted; and Mr. Mathieson's strong
arms had it all done very quickly. Nettie
eagerly thanked him; and then seeing him
in good-humour with her, she ventured something
more.</p>

<p>"Mother's very tired to-day, father," she
whispered; "she'll feel better by and by if
she has a little rest. Do you think you
would mind helping me put up this bedstead?"</p>

<p>"Well, here goes!" said Mr. Mathieson.
"Which piece belongs here, to begin with?"</p>

<p>Nettie did not know much better than he;
but putting not only her whole mind but
also her whole heart into it, she managed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
find out and direct him successfully. Her
part was hard work; she had to stand holding
up the heavy end of the bedstead while her
father fitted in the long pieces; and then she
helped him to lace the cords, which had to
be drawn very tight; and precious time was
running away fast, and Nettie had had no
dinner. But she stood patiently, with a
thought in her heart which kept her in
peace all the while. When it was done, Mr.
Mathieson went out; and Nettie returned to
her mother. She was sitting where she had
left her. Barry was gone.</p>

<p>"Mother, wont you have something to
eat?"</p>

<p>"I can't eat, child. Have you had anything
yourself?"</p>

<p>Nettie had seized a remnant of her father's
toast, and was munching it hastily.</p>

<p>"Mother, wont you put on your gown and
come to church this afternoon? Do! It
will rest you. Do, mother!"</p>

<p>"You forget I've got to get supper, child.
Your father doesn't think it necessary that
anybody should rest, or go to church, or do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
anything except work. What he is thinking
of, I am sure I don't know. There is no
place to eat in but this room, and he is going
to bring a stranger into it; and if I was
dying I should have to get up for every meal
that is wanted. I never thought I should
come to live so! And I cannot dress myself,
or prepare the victuals, or have a moment to
myself, but I have the chance of Mr. Lumber
and your father in here to look on! It is
worse than a dog's life!"</p>

<p>It looked pretty bad, Nettie thought. She
did not know what to say. She began clearing
away the things on the table.</p>

<p>"And what sort of a man this Mr. Lumber
is, I don't know. I dare say he is like his
name&mdash;one of your father's cronies&mdash;a drinker
and a swearer. And Mr. Mathieson will
bring him here, to be on my hands! It will
kill me before spring, if it lasts."</p>

<p>"Couldn't there be a bed made somewhere
else for Barry, mother? and then we could
eat in there."</p>

<p>"Where would you make it? I could
curtain off a corner of this room, but Barry
wouldn't have it, nor your father; and they'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
all want to be close to the fire the minute
the weather grows the least bit cool. No&mdash;there
is nothing for me, but to live on till
Death calls for me!"</p>

<p>"Mother&mdash;Jesus said, 'He that liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.'"</p>

<p>"O yes!" said Mrs. Mathieson, with a kind
of long-drawn groan, "I don't know how it
will be about that! I get so put about, now
in these times, that it seems to me I don't
know my own soul!"</p>

<p>"Mother, come to church this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I can't, child. I've got to put up that
man's bed and make it."</p>

<p>"That is all done, mother, and the floor
brushed up. Do come!"</p>

<p>"Why, who put it up?"</p>

<p>"Father and I."</p>

<p>"Well! you do beat all, Nettie. But I
can't, child; I haven't time."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, plenty. There's all the
hour of Sunday-school before church begins.
Now do, mother!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;you go off to school; and if I can,
maybe I will. You go right off, Nettie."</p>

<p>Nettie went, feeling weary and empty by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
dint of hard work and a dinner of a small bit
of dry toast. But she thought little about
that. She wanted to ask Mr. Folke a
question.</p>

<p>The lesson that afternoon was upon the
peacemakers; and Mr. Folke asked the
children what ways they knew of being a
peacemaker? The answer somehow was not
very ready.</p>

<p>"Isn't it to stop people from quarrelling?"
one child asked.</p>

<p>"How can you do that, Kizzy?"</p>

<p>Kizzy seemed doubtful. "I could ask
them to stop," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you did. Would angry
people mind your asking?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. If they were very
angry, I suppose they wouldn't."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. One thing is certain,
Kizzy; you must have peace in your own
heart, to give you the least chance."</p>

<p>"How, Mr. Folke?"</p>

<p>"If you want to put out a fire, you must
not stick into it something that will catch?"</p>

<p>"That would make the fire worse," said
one of the girls.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
"Certainly. So if you want to touch
quarrelsome spirits with the least hope of
softening them, you must be so full of the
love of Jesus yourself that nothing but love
can come out of your own spirit. You see it
means a good deal, to be a peacemaker."</p>

<p>"I always thought that must be one of the
easiest things of the whole lot," said one of
the class.</p>

<p>"You wont find it so, I think; or rather
you will find they are all parts of the same
character, and the blessing is one. But there
are more ways of being a peacemaker.
What do you do when the hinge of a door
creaks?"</p>

<p>One said "she didn't know;" another said
"Nothing." "I stop my ears," said a third.
Mr. Folke laughed.</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> would not do for a peacemaker,"
he said. "Don't you know what makes
machinery work smoothly?"</p>

<p>"Oil!" cried Kizzy.</p>

<p>"Oil to be sure. One little drop of oil
will stop ever so much creaking and groaning
and complaining, of hinges and wheels and
all sorts of machines. Now, peoples' tempers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
are like wheels and hinges&mdash;but what sort of
oil shall we use?"</p>

<p>The girls looked at each other, and then
one of them said, "Kindness."</p>

<p>"To be sure! A gentle word, a look of
love, a little bit of kindness, will smooth
down a roughened temper or a wry face, and
soften a hard piece of work, and make all go
easily. And so of reproving sinners. The
Psalmist says, 'Let the righteous smite me;
it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove
me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall
not break my head.' But you see the peacemaker
must be righteous himself, or he
hasn't the oil. Love is the oil; the love of
Jesus."</p>

<p>"Mr. Folke," said Nettie, timidly, "wasn't
Jesus a peacemaker?"</p>

<p>"The greatest that ever lived!" said Mr.
Folke, his eyes lighting up with pleasure at
her question. "He made all the peace
there is in the world, for he bought it, when
he died on the cross to reconcile man with
God. All our drops of oil were bought with
drops of blood."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
"And," said Nettie, hesitatingly, "Mr.
Folke, isn't that one way of being a peacemaker?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I mean, to persuade people to be at
peace with him?"</p>

<p>"That is the way above all others, my
child; that is truly to be the 'children of
God.' Jesus came and preached peace; and
that is what his servants are doing, and will
do, till he comes. And 'they shall be called
the children of God.' 'Beloved, if God so
loved us, we ought also to love one another.'"</p>

<p>Mr. Folke paused, with a face so full of
thought, of eagerness, and of love, that none
of the children spoke and some of them
wondered. And before Mr. Folke spoke
again the superintendent's little bell rang;
and they all stood up to sing. But Nettie
Mathieson hardly could sing; it seemed to
her so glorious a thing to be <em>that</em> sort of a
peacemaker. Could she be one? But the
Lord blessed the peacemakers; then it must
be his will that all his children should be
such; then he would enable her to be one!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
It was a great thought. Nettie's heart
swelled, with hope and joy and prayer. She
knew whose peace she longed for, first of all.</p>

<p>Her mother had now come to church; so
Nettie enjoyed all the services with nothing
to hinder. Then they walked home together,
not speaking much to each other, but every
step of the way pleasant in the Sunday afternoon
light, till they got to their own door.
Nettie knew what her mother's sigh meant,
as they mounted the stairs. Happily,
nobody was at home yet but themselves.</p>

<p>"Now, mother," said Nettie, when she had
changed her dress and come to the common
room,&mdash;"what's to be for supper? I'll get it.
You sit still and read, if you want to, while
it's quiet. What must we have?"</p>

<p>"There is not a great deal to do," said
Mrs. Mathieson. "I boiled the pork this
morning, and that was what set your father
up so; that's ready; and he says there must
be cakes. The potatoes are all ready to put
down&mdash;I was going to boil 'em this morning,
and he stopped me."</p>

<p>Nettie looked grave about the cakes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
"However, mother," she said, "I don't believe
that little loaf of bread would last, even if
you and I didn't touch it; it is not very big."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson wearily sat down and took
her Testament, as Nettie begged her; and
Nettie put on the kettle and the pot of
potatoes, and made the cakes ready to bake.
The table was set, and the treacle and everything
on it, except the hot things, when
Barry burst in.</p>

<p>"Hollo, cakes!&mdash;hollo, treacle!" he shouted.
"Pork and treacle&mdash;that's the right sort of
thing. Now we're going to live something
like."</p>

<p>"Hush, Barry, don't make such a noise,"
said his sister. "You know it's Sunday
evening."</p>

<p>"Sunday! well, what about Sunday?
What's Sunday good for, except to eat, I
should like to know?"</p>

<p>"O Barry!"</p>

<p>"O Barry!" said he, mimicking her. "Come,
shut up, and fry your cake. Father and
Lumber will be here just now."</p>

<p>Nettie hushed, as she was bade; and as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
soon as her father's step was heard below,
she went to frying cakes with all her might.
She just turned her head to give one look at
Mr. Lumber as he came in. He appeared
to her very like her father, but without the
recommendation which her affection gave
to Mr. Mathieson. A big, strong, burly fellow,
with the same tinges of red about his face,
that the summer sun had never brought
there. Nettie did not want to look again.</p>

<p>She had a good specimen this evening of
what they might expect in future. Mrs.
Mathieson poured out the tea, and Nettie
baked the cakes; and perhaps because she
was almost faint for want of something to
eat, she thought no three people ever ate so
many griddle cakes before at one meal. In
vain plateful after plateful went upon the
board, and Nettie baked them as fast as she
could; they were eaten just as fast; and
when finally the chairs were pushed back,
and the men went down stairs, Nettie and
her mother looked at each other.</p>

<p>"There's only one left, mother," said Nettie.</p>

<p>"And he has eaten certainly half the piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of pork," said Mrs. Mathieson. "Come, child,
take something yourself; you're ready to
drop. I'll clear away."</p>

<p>But it is beyond the power of any disturbance
to take away the gladness of a heart
where Jesus is. Nettie's bread was sweet to
her, even that evening. Before she had well
finished her supper, her father and his lodger
came back. They sat down on either side
the fire and began to talk,&mdash;of politics, and of
their work on which they were then engaged,
with their employers and their fellow-workmen;
of the state of business in the village,
and profits and losses, and the success of particular
men in making money. They talked
loudly and eagerly; and Nettie had to go
round and round them, to get to the fire for
hot water and back to the table to wash up
the cups and plates. Her mother was helping
at the table, but to get round Mr. Lumber
to the pot of hot water on the fire every now
and then, fell to Nettie's share. It was not
a very nice ending of her sweet Sabbath day,
she thought. The dishes were done and put
away, and still the talk went on as hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
as ever. It was sometimes a pleasure to
Nettie's father to hear her sing hymns of a
Sunday evening. Nettie watched for a
chance, and the first time there was a lull of
the voices of the two men, she asked, softly,
"Shall I sing, father?" Mr. Mathieson
hesitated, and then answered, "No, better
not, Nettie; Mr. Lumber might not find it
amusing;" and the talk began again. Nettie
waited a little longer, feeling exceedingly
tired; then she rose and lit a candle.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Nettie?" her mother
said.</p>

<p>"I am going to bed, mother."</p>

<p>"You can't take a candle up there, child!
the attic's all full of things, and you'd certainly
set us on fire."</p>

<p>"I'll take great care, mother."</p>

<p>"But you can't, child! The wind might
blow the snuff of your candle right into something
that would be all a flame by the
time you're asleep. You must manage without
a light somehow."</p>

<p>"But I can't see to find my way," said
Nettie, who was secretly trembling with fear.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
"I'll light you then, for once, and you'll
soon learn the way. Give me the candle."</p>

<p>Nettie hushed the words that came crowding
into her mouth, and clambered up the
steep stairs to the attic. Mrs. Mathieson
followed her with the candle till she got to
the top, and there she held it till Nettie had
found her way to the other end where her
bed was. Then she said good-night and
went down.</p>

<p>The little square shutter of the window
was open, and a ray of moonlight streamed
in upon the bed. It was nicely made up;
Nettie saw that her mother had been there
and had done that for her and wrought a
little more space and order among the things
around the bed. But the moonlight did not
get in far enough to show much more. Just
a little of this thing and of that could be
seen; a corner of a chest, or a gleam on the
side of a meal bag; the half light showed
nothing clearly except the confused fulness
of the little attic. Nettie had given her head
a blow against a piece of timber as she came
through it; and she sat down upon her little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
bed, feeling rather miserable. Her fear was
that the rats might visit her up there. She
did not certainly know that there were rats
in the attic, but she had been fearing to think
of them and did not dare to ask; as well as
unwilling to give trouble to her mother; for
if they <em>did</em> come there, Nettie did not see
how the matter could be mended. She sat
down on her little bed, so much frightened
that she forgot how tired she was. Her ears
were as sharp as needles, listening to hear
the scrape of a rat's tooth upon a timber or
the patter of his feet over the floor.</p>

<p>For a few minutes Nettie almost thought
she could not sleep up there alone, and must
go down and implore her mother to let her
spread her bed in a corner of her room. But
what a bustle that would make. Her mother
would be troubled, and her father would be
angry, and the lodger would be disturbed,
and there was no telling how much harm
would come of it. No; the peacemaker of
the family must not do that. And then the
words floated into Nettie's mind again,
"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
be called the children of God." Like a strain
of the sweetest music it floated in; and if an
angel had come and brought the words
straight to Nettie, she could not have been
more comforted. She felt the rats could not
hurt her while she was within hearing of
that music; and she got up and kneeled
down upon the chest under the little window
and looked out.</p>

<p>It was like the day that had passed; not
like the evening. So purely and softly the
moonbeams lay on all the fields and trees
and hills, there was no sign of anything but
peace and purity to be seen. No noise of
men's work or voices; no clangour of the
iron foundry which on weekdays might be
heard; no sight of anything unlovely; but
the wide beauty which God had made, and
the still peace and light which he had spread
over it. Every little flapping leaf seemed to
Nettie to tell of its Maker; and the music of
those words seemed to be all through the
still air&mdash;"Blessed are the peacemakers, for
they shall be called the children of God."
Tears of gladness and hope slowly gathered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in Nettie's eyes. The children of God will
enter in, by and by, through those pearly
gates, into that city of gold,&mdash;"where they
need no candle, neither light of the sun, for
the Lord God giveth them light." "So he can
give me light here&mdash;or what's better than
light," thought Nettie. "God isn't only out
there, in all that beautiful moonlight world&mdash;he
is here in my poor little attic too; and
he will take just as good care of me as he
does of the birds, and better, for I am his
child, and they are only his beautiful little
servants."</p>

<p>Nettie's fear was gone. She prayed her
evening prayer; she trusted herself to the
Lord Jesus to take care of her; and then she
undressed herself and lay down and went to
sleep, just as quietly as any sparrow of them
all with its head under its wing.</p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<h3>NETTIE'S GARRET.</h3>


<p>Nettie's attic grew to be a good place to
her. She never heard the least sound of rats;
and it was so nicely out of the way. Barry
never came up there, and there she could not
even hear the voices of her father and Mr.
Lumber. She had a tired time of it down
stairs.</p>

<p>That first afternoon was a good specimen
of the way things went on. Nettie's mornings
were always spent at school; Mrs.
Mathieson would have that, as she said,
whether she could get along without Nettie
or no. From the time Nettie got home till
she went to bed, she was as busy as she could
be. There was so much bread to make, and
so much beef and pork to boil, and so much
washing of pots and kettles; and at meal
times there were very often cakes to fry, besides
all the other preparations. Mr. Mathieson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
seemed to have made up his mind
that his lodger's rent should all go to the
table and be eaten up immediately; but
the difficulty was to make as much as he expected
of it in that line; for now he brought
none of his own earnings home, and Mrs.
Mathieson had more than a sad guess where
they went. By degrees he came to be very
little at home in the evenings, and he carried
off Barry with him. Nettie saw her mother
burdened with a great outward and inward
care at once, and stood in the breach all she
could. She worked to the extent of her
strength, and beyond it, in the endless getting
and clearing away of meals; and watching
every chance, when the men were out of the
way, she would coax her mother to sit down
and read a chapter in her Testament. "It
will rest you so, mother," Nettie would say;
"and I will make the bread just as soon as I
get the dishes done. Do let me! I like to
do it."</p>

<p>Sometimes Mrs. Mathieson could not be
persuaded; sometimes she would yield, in
a despondent kind of way, and sit down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with her Testament and look at it as if
neither there nor anywhere else in the universe
could she find rest or comfort any more.</p>

<p>"It don't signify, child," she said, one afternoon
when Nettie had been urging her to sit
down and read. "I haven't the heart to do
anything. We're all driving to rack and ruin
just as fast as we can go."</p>

<p>"Oh no, mother!" said Nettie. "I don't
think we are."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. I see it coming every
day. Every day it is a little worse; and
Barry is going along with your father; and
they are destroying me among them, body
and soul too."</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Nettie, "I don't think
that. I have prayed the Lord Jesus, and
you know he has promised to hear prayer;
and I know we are not going to ruin."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> are not, child, I believe; but you
are the only one of us that isn't. I wish I
was dead, to be out of my misery!"</p>

<p>"Sit down, mother, and read a little bit;
and don't talk so. Do, mother! It will be
an hour and more yet to supper, and I'll get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
it ready. You sit down and read, and I'll
make the shortcakes. Do, mother! and
you'll feel better."</p>

<p>It was half despair and half persuasion
that made her do it; but Mrs. Mathieson
did sit down by the open window and take
her Testament; and Nettie flew quietly
about, making her shortcakes and making
up the fire and setting the table, and through
it all casting many a loving glance over to
the open book in her mother's hand and the
weary, stony face that was bent over it.
Nettie had not said how her own back was
aching, and she forgot it almost in her business
and her thoughts; though by the time
her work was done her head was aching
wearily too. But cakes and table and fire
and everything else were in readiness; and
Nettie stole up behind her mother and leaned
over her shoulder; leaned a little heavily.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "Don't that chapter comfort you, mother?"
she whispered.</p>

<p>"No. It don't seem to me as I've got any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
feeling left," said Mrs. Mathieson. It was
the fourth chapter of John at which they
were both looking.</p>

<p>"Don't it comfort you to read of Jesus
being wearied?" Nettie went on, her head
lying on her mother's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why should it, child?"</p>

<p>"I like to read it," said Nettie. "Then I
know he knows how I feel sometimes."</p>

<p>"God knows everything, Nettie."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; but then Jesus <em>felt</em> it. 'He
took our infirmities.' And oh, mother, don't
you love that tenth verse?&mdash;and the thirteenth
and fourteenth?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson looked at it, silently; then
she said, "I don't rightly understand it,
Nettie. I suppose I ought to do so,&mdash;but I
don't."</p>

<p>"Why, mother! I understand it. It
means, that if Jesus makes you happy,
you'll never be unhappy again. 'Whosoever
drinketh of the water that I shall give him,
<em>shall never thirst</em>,'&mdash;don't you see, mother?
'Shall never thirst,'&mdash;he will have enough,
and be satisfied."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
"How do you know it, Nettie?" her mother
asked, in a puzzled kind of way.</p>

<p>"I know it, mother, because Jesus has
given that living water to me."</p>

<p>"He never gave it to me," said Mrs.
Mathieson, in the same tone.</p>

<p>"But he <em>will</em>, mother. Look up there&mdash;oh,
how I love that tenth verse!&mdash;'If thou
knewest the gift of God, and who it is that
saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest
have asked of him, and he would have given
thee living water.' See, mother,&mdash;he will
give, if we ask."</p>

<p>"And do you feel so, Nettie?&mdash;that you
have enough, and are satisfied with your life
every day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," Nettie said, quietly; "I
am very happy. I am happy all the time;
because I think that Jesus is with me everywhere;
when I'm upstairs, and when I'm
busy here, and when I'm at school, and when
I go to the spring; and all times. And
that makes me very happy."</p>

<p>"And don't you wish for anything you
haven't got?" said her mother.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
"Yes, one thing," said Nettie. "I just
wish that you and father and Barry may be
so happy too; and I believe that's coming;
for I've prayed the Lord, and I believe he
will give it to me. I want it for other people
too. I often think, when I am looking at
somebody, of those words&mdash;'If thou knewest
the gift of God, thou wouldest have asked
of him, and he would have given thee living
water.'"</p>

<p>With that, Mrs. Mathieson cast down her
book and burst into such a passion of weeping
that Nettie was frightened. It was like the
breaking up of an icy winter. She flung her
apron over her head and sobbed aloud; till
hearing the steps of the men upon the
staircase she rushed off to Barry's room, and
presently got quiet, for she came out to
supper as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>From that time there was a gentler mood
upon her mother, Nettie saw; though she
looked weary and careworn as ever, there
was not now often the hard, dogged look
which had been wont to be there for months
past. Nettie had no difficulty to get her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
read the Testament; and of all things, what
she liked was to get a quiet hour of an evening
alone with Nettie and hear her sing hymns.
But both Nettie and she had a great deal, as
Mrs. Mathieson said, "to put up with."</p>

<p>As weeks went on, the father of the family
was more and more out at nights, and less
and less agreeable when he was at home. He
and his friend Lumber helped each other in
mischief: they went together to Jackson's
shop and spent time in lounging and gossiping
and talking politics there; and what was
worse, they made the time and the politics
go down with draughts of liquor. Less and
less money came to Mrs. Mathieson's hand;
but her husband always required what he
called a good meal to be ready for him and
his lodger whenever he came home, and
made no difference in his expectations
whether he had provided the means or not.
The lodger's rent and board had been at
first given for the household daily expenses;
but then Mr. Mathieson began to pay over a
smaller sum, saying that it was all that was
due; and Mrs. Mathieson suspected that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
rest had been paid away already for brandy.
Then Mr. Mathieson told her to trade at
Jackson's on account, and he would settle
the bill. Mrs. Mathieson held off from this
as long as it was possible. She and Nettie
did their very best to make the little that
was given them go a good way; they wasted
not a crumb nor a penny, and did not spend
on themselves what they really wanted; that
they might not have the fearful storm of
anger which was sure to come if the dinner
was not plentiful and the supper did not
please the taste of Mr. Mathieson and his
lodger. By degrees it came to be very customary
for Mrs. Mathieson and Nettie to
make their meal of porridge and bread, after
all the more savoury food had been devoured
by the others; and many a weary patch and
darn filled the night hours because they had
not money to buy a cheap dress or two.
Nettie bore it very patiently. Mrs. Mathieson
was sometimes impatient.</p>

<p>"This wont last me through the week, to
get the things you want," she said one
Saturday to her husband, when he gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
her what he said was Lumber's payment to
him.</p>

<p>"You'll have to make it last," said he,
gruffly.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me how I'm going to do
that? Here isn't more than half what you
gave me at first."</p>

<p>"Send to Jackson's for what you want!"
he roared at her; "didn't I tell you so? and
don't come bothering me with your noise."</p>

<p>"When will you pay Jackson?"</p>

<p>"I'll pay you first!" he said, with an oath,
and very violently. It was a ruder word
than he had ever said to her before, and Mrs.
Mathieson was staggered for a moment by it;
but there was another word she was determined
to say.</p>

<p>"You may do what you like to me," she
said, doggedly; "but I should think you
would see for yourself that Nettie has too
much to get along with. She is getting just
as thin and pale as she can be."</p>

<p>"That's just your fool's nonsense!" said
Mr. Mathieson; but he spoke it more quietly.
Nettie just then entered the room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
"Here, Nettie, what ails you? Come
here. Let's look at you. Aint you as strong
as ever you was? Here's your mother says
you're getting puny."</p>

<p>Nettie's smile and answer were so placid
and untroubled, and the little colour that
rose in her cheeks at her father's question
made her look so fresh and well, that he was
quieted. He drew her to his arms, for his
gentle dutiful little daughter had a place in
his respect and affection both, though he did
not often show it very broadly; but now he
kissed her.</p>

<p>"There!" said he; "don't you go to
growing thin and weak without telling me,
for I don't like such doings. You tell me
when you want anything." But with that,
Mr. Mathieson got up and went off, out of the
house; and Nettie had small chance to tell
him if she wanted anything. However, this
little word and kiss were a great comfort and
pleasure to her. It was the last she had
from him in a good while.</p>

<p>Nettie, however, was not working for
praise or kisses, and very little of either she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
got. Generally her father was rough, imperious,
impatient, speaking fast enough if
anything went wrong, but very sparing in
expressions of pleasure. Sometimes a blessing
did come upon her from the very depth
of Mrs. Mathieson's heart, and went straight
to Nettie's; but it was for another blessing
she laboured, and prayed, and waited.</p>

<p>So weeks went by. So her patient little
feet went up and down the stairs with pails
of water from the spring; and her hands
made bread and baked cakes, and set rooms
in order; and it was Nettie always who went
to Mr. Jackson's for meal and treacle, and to
Mrs. Auguste's, the little Frenchwoman's, as
she was called, for a loaf when they were
now and then out of bread. And with her
mornings spent at school, Nettie's days were
very busy ones; and the feet that at night
mounted the steps to her attic room were
aching and tired enough. All the more that
now Nettie and her mother lived half the
the time on porridge; all the provision they
dared make of other things being quite consumed
by the three hearty appetites that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
were before them at the meal. And Nettie's
appetite was not at all hearty, and sometimes
she could hardly eat at all.</p>

<p>As the summer passed away it began to
grow cold, too, up in her garret. Nettie had
never thought of that. As long as the summer
sun warmed the roof well in the day, and
only the soft summer wind played in and
out of her window at night, it was all very
well; and Nettie thought her sleeping-chamber
was the best in the whole house, for it was
nearest the sky. But August departed with
its sunny days, and September grew cool at
evening; and October brought still sunny
days, it is true, but the nights had a clear
sharp frost in them; and Nettie was obliged
to cover herself up warm in bed and look at
the moonlight and the stars as she could see
them through the little square opening left
by the shutter. The stars looked very lovely
to Nettie, when they peeped at her so, in her
bed, out of their high heaven; and she was
very content.</p>

<p>Then came November; and the winds
began to come into the garret, not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
through the open window, but through every
crack between two boards. The whole garret
was filled with the winds, Nettie thought.
It was hard managing then. Shutting the
shutter would bar out the stars, but not the
wind, she found; and to keep from being
quite chilled through at her times of prayer
morning and evening, Nettie used to take
the blanket and coverlets from the bed and
wrap herself in them. It was all she could
do. Still, she forgot the inconveniences;
and her little garret chamber seemed to
Nettie very near heaven, as well as near the
sky.</p>

<p>But all this way of life did not make her
grow strong, nor rosy; and though Nettie
never told her father that she wanted anything,
her mother's heart measured the times
when it ought to be told.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE BROWN CLOAK IN NOVEMBER.</h3>


<p>November days drew toward an end; December
was near. One afternoon Mrs.
Mathieson, wanting Nettie, went to the foot
of the garret stairs to call her, and stopped,
hearing Nettie's voice singing. It was a
clear, bird-like voice, and Mrs. Mathieson
listened; at first she could not distinguish
the words, but then came a refrain which
was plain enough.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Glory, glory, glory, glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Glory be to God on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">Glory, glory, glory, glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sing his praises through the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">Glory, glory, glory, glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Glory to the Father give,<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">Glory, glory, glory, glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sing his praises all that live."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson's heart gave way. She sat
down on the lowest step and cried, for very
soreness of heart. But work must be done;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and when the song had ceased, for it went
on some time, Mrs. Mathieson wiped her
tears with her apron and called, "Nettie!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother. Coming."</p>

<p>"Fetch down your school-cloak, child."</p>

<p>She went back to her room, and presently
Nettie came in with the cloak, looking placid
as usual, but very pale.</p>

<p>"Are you singing up there to keep yourself
warm, child?"</p>

<p>"Well, mother, I don't know but it does,"
Nettie answered, smiling. "My garret did
seem to me full of glory just now; and it
often does, mother."</p>

<p>"The Lord save us!" exclaimed Mrs.
Mathieson, bursting into tears again. "I
believe you're in a way to be going above,
before my face!"</p>

<p>"Now, mother, what sort of a way is that
of talking?" said Nettie, looking troubled.
"You know I can't die till Jesus bids me;
and I don't think he is going to take me
now. What did you want me to do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. You aint fit. I must go and
do it myself."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
"Yes I am fit. I like to do it," said
Nettie. "What is it, mother?"</p>

<p>"Somebody's got to go to Mr. Jackson's&mdash;but
you aint fit, child; you eat next to none
at noon. You can't live on porridge."</p>

<p>"I like it, mother; but I wasn't hungry.
What's wanting from Jackson's?"</p>

<p>Nettie put on her cloak, and took her
basket and went out. It was after sundown
already, and a keen wind swept through the
village street, and swept through Nettie's
brown cloak too, tight as she wrapped it
about her. But though she was cold and
blue, and the wind seemed to go through
<em>her</em> as well as the cloak, Nettie was thinking
of something else. She knew that her
mother had eaten a very scanty, poor sort of
dinner, as well as herself, and that <em>she</em> often
looked pale and wan; and Nettie was almost
ready to wish she had not given the last
penny of her shilling, on Sunday, to the
missionary-box. When her father had given
her the coin, she had meant then to keep it
to buy something now and then for her
mother; but it was not immediately needed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and one by one the pennies had gone to
buy tracts, or as a mite to the fund for
sending Bibles or missionaries to those who
did not know how to sing Nettie's song of
"glory."</p>

<p>She wondered to herself now if she had
done quite right; she could not help thinking
that if she had one penny she could buy a
smoked herring, which, with a bit of bread
and tea, would make a comfortable supper
for her mother, which she could relish. Had
she done right? But one more thought of
the children and grown people who have not
the Bible,&mdash;who know nothing of the golden
city with its gates of pearl, and are nowise
fit to enter by those pure entrances where
"nothing that defileth" can go in,&mdash;and
Nettie wished no more for a penny back that
she had given to bring them there. She
hugged herself in her cloak, and as she went
quick along the darkening ways, the light
from that city seemed to shine in her heart
and make warmth through the cold. She
was almost sorry to go to Mr. Jackson's shop;
it had grown rather a disagreeable place to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
her lately. It was half full of people, as
usual at that hour.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said Mr. Jackson,
rather curtly, when Nettie's turn came and
she had told her errand. "What!" he exclaimed,
"seven pounds of meal and a pound
of butter, and two pounds of sugar! Well, you
tell your father that I should like to have
my bill settled; it's all drawn up, you see,
and I don't like to open a new account till
it's all square."</p>

<p>He turned away immediately to another
customer, and Nettie felt she had got her
answer. She stood a moment, very disappointed,
and a little mortified, and somewhat
downhearted. What should they do
for supper? and what a storm there would
be when her father heard about all this and
found nothing but bread and tea on the
table. Slowly Nettie turned away, and slowly
made the few steps from the door to the
corner. She felt very blue indeed; coming
out of the warm store the chill wind made
her shiver. Just at the corner somebody
stopped her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
"Nettie!" said the voice of the little
French baker, "what ails you? you look
not well."</p>

<p>Nettie gave her a grateful smile, and said
she was well.</p>

<p>"You look not like it," said Mme. Auguste;
"you look as if the wind might
carry you off before you get home. Come
to my house&mdash;I want to see you in the light."</p>

<p>"I haven't time; I must go home to
mother, Mrs. August."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know! You will go home all the
faster for coming this way first. You have
not been to see me in these three or four
weeks."</p>

<p>She carried Nettie along with her; it was
but a step, and Nettie did not feel capable
of resisting anything. The little Frenchwoman
put her into the shop before her,
made her sit down, and lighted a candle.
The shop was nice and warm and full of the
savoury smell of fresh baking.</p>

<p>"We have made our own bread lately,"
said Nettie, in answer to the charge of not
coming there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
"Do you make it good?" said Mme. Auguste.</p>

<p>"It isn't like yours, Mrs. August," said
Nettie, smiling.</p>

<p>"If you will come and live with me next
summer, I will teach you how to do some
things; and you shall not look so blue neither.
Have you had your supper?"</p>

<p>"No, and I am just going home to get
supper. I must go, Mrs. August."</p>

<p>"You come in here," said the Frenchwoman;
"you are my prisoner. I am all
alone, and I want somebody for company.
You take off your cloak, Nettie, and I shall
give you something to keep the wind out.
You do what I bid you!"</p>

<p>Nettie felt too cold and weak to make any
ado about complying, unless duty had forbade;
and she thought there was time enough
yet. She let her cloak drop, and took off
her hood. The little back room to which
Mme. Auguste had brought her was only a
trifle bigger than the bit of a shop; but it
was as cozy as it was little. A tiny stove
warmed it, and kept warm, too, a tiny iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
pot and tea-kettle which were steaming
away. The bed was at one end, draped
nicely with red curtains; there was a little
looking-glass, and some prints in frames round
the walls; there was Madame's little table
covered with a purple cloth, and with her
work and a small clock and various pretty
things on it. Mme. Auguste had gone to a
cupboard in the wall, and taken out a couple
of plates and little bowls, which she set on a
little round stand; and then lifting the cover
of the pot on the stove, she ladled out a
bowlful of what was in it, and gave it to
Nettie with one of her own nice crisp rolls.</p>

<p>"Eat that!" she said. "I shan't let you
go home till you have swallowed that to
keep the cold out. It makes me all freeze
to look at you."</p>

<p>So she filled her own bowl, and made good
play with her spoon, while between spoonfuls
she looked at Nettie; and the good little
woman smiled in her heart to see how easy
it was for Nettie to obey her. The savoury,
simple, comforting broth she had set before
her was the best thing to the child's delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
stomach that she had tasted for many a
day.</p>

<p>"Is it good?" said the Frenchwoman when
Nettie's bowl was half empty.</p>

<p>"It's so good!" said Nettie. "I didn't
know I was so hungry."</p>

<p>"Now you will not feel the cold so," said
the Frenchwoman, "and you will go back
quicker. Do you like my <em>riz-au-gras</em>?"</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> is it, ma'am?" said Nettie.</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman laughed, and made
Nettie say it over till she could pronounce
the words. "Now you like it," she said;
"that is a French dish. Do you think Mrs.
Mat'ieson would like it?"</p>

<p>"I am sure she would!" said Nettie. "But
I don't know how to make it."</p>

<p>"You shall come here and I will teach
it to you. And now you shall carry a little
home to your mother and ask her if she will
do the honour to a French dish to approve
it. It do not cost anything. I cannot sell
much bread the winters; I live on what cost
me nothing."</p>

<p>While saying this, Mme. Auguste had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
filled a little pail with the <em>riz-au-gras</em>, and
put a couple of her rolls along with it. "It
must have the French bread," she said; and
she gave it to Nettie, who looked quite
cheered up, and very grateful.</p>

<p>"You are a good little girl!" she said.
"How keep you always your face looking so
happy? There is always one little streak of
sunshine here"&mdash;drawing her finger across
above Nettie's eyebrows&mdash;"and another here,"&mdash;and
her finger passed over the line of Nettie's
lips.</p>

<p>"That's because I <em>am</em> happy, Mrs. August."</p>

<p>"<em>Always?</em>"</p>

<p>"Yes, always."</p>

<p>"What makes you so happy always? you
was just the same in the cold winter out
there, as when you was eating my <em>riz-au-gras</em>.
Now me, I am cross in the cold, and
not happy."</p>

<p>But the Frenchwoman saw a deeper light
come into Nettie's eyes as she answered, "It
is because I love the Lord Jesus, Mrs. August,
and he makes me happy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
"<em>You?</em>" said Madame. "My child!&mdash;What
do you say, Nettie? I think not I
have heard you right."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. August, I am happy because
I love the Lord Jesus. I know he loves me,
and he will take me to be with him."</p>

<p>"Not just yet," said the Frenchwoman,
"I hope! Well, I wish I was so happy as
you, Nettie. Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Nettie ran home, more comforted by her
good supper, and more thankful to the goodness
of God in giving it, and happy in the
feeling of his goodness than can be told.
And very, very glad she was of that little
tin pail in her hand she knew her mother
needed. Mrs. Mathieson had time to eat
the rice broth before her husband came
in.</p>

<p>"She said she would show me how to
make it," said Nettie, "and it don't cost anything."</p>

<p>"Why, it's just rice and&mdash;<em>what</em> is it? I
don't see," said Mrs. Mathieson. "It isn't
rice and milk."</p>

<p>Nettie laughed at her mother. "Mrs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
August didn't tell. She called it reeso&mdash;&mdash;
I forget what she called it!"</p>

<p>"It's the best thing I ever saw," said Mrs.
Mathieson. "There&mdash;put the pail away.
Your father's coming."</p>

<p>He was in a terrible humour, as they expected;
and Nettie and her mother had a
sad evening of it. And the same sort of
thing lasted for several days. Mrs. Mathieson
hoped that perhaps Mr. Lumber would
take into his head to seek lodgings somewhere
else; or at least that Mathieson would
have been shamed into paying Jackson's
bill; but neither thing happened. Mr.
Lumber found his quarters too comfortable;
and Mr. Mathieson spent too much of his
earnings on drink to find the amount necessary
to clear off the scores at the grocer's
shop.</p>

<p>From that time, as they could run up no
new account, the family were obliged to live
on what they could immediately pay for.
That was seldom a sufficient supply; and so,
in dread of the storms that came whenever
their wants touched Mr. Mathieson's own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
comfort, Nettie and her mother denied themselves
constantly what they very much needed.
The old can sometimes bear this better than
the young. Nettie grew more delicate, more
thin, and more feeble, every day. It troubled
her mother sadly. Mr. Mathieson could not
be made to see it. Indeed he was little at
home except when he was eating.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE NEW BLANKET.</h3>


<p>Nettie had been in Barry's room one evening,
putting it to rights; through the busy day
it had somehow been neglected. Mrs. Mathieson's
heart was so heavy that her work
dragged; and when Nettie came out and
sat down to her Sunday-school lesson, her
mother kept watching her for a long time
with a dull, listless face, quite still and idle.
The child's face was busy over her Bible, and
Mrs. Mathieson did not disturb her, till
Nettie lifted her head to glance at the clock.
Then the bitterness of her mother's heart
broke out.</p>

<p>"He's a ruined man!" she exclaimed, in
her despair. "He's a ruined man! he's
taking to drinking more and more. It's all
over with him&mdash;and with us."</p>

<p>"No, mother," said Nettie, gently,&mdash;"I
hope not. There's better times coming,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
mother. God <em>never</em> forsakes those that
trust in him. He has promised to hear
prayer; and I have prayed to him, and I
feel sure he will save us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson was weeping bitterly.</p>

<p>"So don't you cry, mother. Trust!
'Only believe'&mdash;don't you remember Jesus
said that? Just believe him, mother. I do."</p>

<p>And proving how true she spoke&mdash;how
steadfast and firm was the faith she professed,
with that, as Nettie got up to put
away her books, her lips burst forth into
song; and never more clear nor more sweet
than she sung then, sounded the wild sweet
notes that belong to the words&mdash;favourites
with her. There was no doubt in her voice
at all.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Great spoils I shall win, from death, hell, and sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">'Midst outward afflictions shall feel Christ within;<br /></span>

<span class="i1a">For Jesus hath loved me, I cannot tell why."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson sobbed at first; but there
came a great quietness over her; and as the
clear beautiful strain came to an end, she
rose up, threw her apron over her face, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
knelt quietly down by the side of her bed;
putting her face in her hands. Nettie stood
and looked at her; then turned and went up
the stair to her own praying-place; feeling in
her heart as if instead of two weary feet she
had had "wings as angels," to mount up
literally. She knew that part of her prayer
was getting its answer. She knew by the
manner of her mother, that it was in no
bitterness and despair but in the humbleness
of a bowed heart that she had knelt down;
and Nettie's slow little feet kept company
with a most bounding spirit. She went to
bed and covered herself up, not to sleep, but
because it was too cold to be in the garret
a moment uncovered; and lay there broad
awake, "making melody in her heart to the
Lord."</p>

<p>It was very cold up in Nettie's garret now;
the winter had moved on into the latter part
of December, and the frosts were very keen;
and the winter winds seem to come in at one
end of the attic and to just sweep through to
the other, bringing all except the snow with
them. Even the snow often drifted in through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the cracks of the rough wainscot board, or
under the shutter, and lay in little white
streaks or heaps on the floor, and never
melted. To-night there was no wind, and
Nettie had left her shutter open that she
might see the stars as she lay in bed. It did
not make much difference in the feeling of
the place, for it was about as cold inside as
out; and the stars were great friends of
Nettie. To-night she lay and watched them,
blinking down at her through her garret
window with their quiet eyes; they were
always silent witnesses to her of the beauty
and purity of heaven, and reminders too of
that eye that never sleeps and that hand that
planted and upholds all. How bright they
looked down to-night! It was very cold,
and lying awake made Nettie colder; she
shivered sometimes under all her coverings;
still she lay looking at the stars in that square
patch of sky that her shutter opening gave
her to see, and thinking of the golden city.
"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst
any more; neither shall the sun light on
them, nor any heat. For the lamb which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
is in the midst of the throne shall feed them,
and shall lead them unto living fountains of
waters: and God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes." "There shall be no more
curse; but the throne of God and of the
Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall
serve him."</p>

<p>"His servants shall serve him"&mdash;thought
Nettie; "and mother will be there,&mdash;and
father will be there, and Barry,&mdash;and I shall
be there! and then I shall be happy. And
I am happy now. 'Blessed be the Lord,
which hath not turned away my prayer, nor
his mercy from me!'"&mdash;And if that verse
went through Nettie's head once, it did fifty
times. So did this one, which the quiet
stars seemed to repeat and whisper to her,
"The Lord redeemeth the soul of his servants,
and none of them that trust in him shall be
desolate." And though now and then a
shiver passed over Nettie's shoulders, with
the cold, she was ready to sing for very
gladness and fulness of heart.</p>

<p>But lying awake and shivering did not
do Nettie's little body any good; she looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
so very white the next day, that it caught
even Mr. Mathieson's attention. He reached
out his arm and drew Nettie toward him, as
she was passing between the cupboard and
the table. Then he looked at her, but he
did not say how she looked.</p>

<p>"Do you know day after to-morrow is
Christmas day?" said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. It's the day when Christ
was born," said Nettie.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know anything about that,"
said her father; "but what I mean is, that a
week after is New Year. What would you
like me to give you, Nettie,&mdash;hey?"</p>

<p>Nettie stood still for a moment, then her
eyes lighted up.</p>

<p>"Will you give it to me, father, if I tell
you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. If it is not extravagant,
perhaps I will."</p>

<p>"It will not cost much," said Nettie, earnestly.
"Will you give me what I choose,
father, if it does not cost too much?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I will. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Father, you wont be displeased?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
"Not I!" said Mr. Mathieson, drawing
Nettie's little form tighter in his grasp; he
thought he had never felt it so slight and
thin before.</p>

<p>"Father, I am going to ask you a great
thing!&mdash;to go to church with me New Year's
day."</p>

<p>"To church!" said her father, frowning;
but he remembered his promise, and he felt
Nettie in his arms yet. "What on earth
good will that do you?"</p>

<p>"A great deal of good. It would please
me so much, father."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to go to church
for?" said Mr. Mathieson, not sure yet what
humour he was going to be in.</p>

<p>"To thank God, father, that there was a
Christmas; when Jesus came, that we might
have a New Year."</p>

<p>"What? what?" said Mr. Mathieson.
"What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Because, father," said Nettie, trembling,
and seizing her chance, "since Jesus loved
us and came and died for us, we all may
have a New Year of glory. I shall, father;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and I want you too. Oh do, father!" and
Nettie burst into tears. Mr. Mathieson held
her fast, and his face showed a succession of
changes for a minute or so. But she presently
raised her head from his shoulder,
where it had sunk, and kissed him, and
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"May I have what I want, father?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;go along," said Mr. Mathieson.
"I should like to know how to refuse you,
though. But, Nettie, don't you want me to
give you anything else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else!" she told him, with her
face all shining with joy. Mr. Mathieson
looked at her and seemed very thoughtful
all supper time.</p>

<p>"Can't you strengthen that child up a
bit?" he said to his wife afterwards. "She
does too much."</p>

<p>"She does as little as I can help," said
Mrs. Mathieson; "but she is always at something.
I am afraid her room is too cold o'
nights. She aint fit to bear it. It's bitter
up there."</p>

<p>"Give her another blanket or quilt, then,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
said her husband. "I should think you
would see to that. Does she say she is
cold?"</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;never except sometimes when I see
her looking blue, and ask her."</p>

<p>"And what does she say then?"</p>

<p>"She says sometimes she is a little cold."</p>

<p>"Well, do put something more over her,
and have no more of it!" said her husband,
violently. "Sit still and let the child be
cold, when another covering would make it
all right!" And he ended with swearing at
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson did not dare to tell him
that Nettie's food was not of a sufficiently
nourishing and relishing kind; she knew
what the answer to that would be; and she
feared that a word more about Nettie's
sleeping-room would be thought an attack
upon Mr. Lumber's being in the house. So
she was silent.</p>

<p>But there came home something for Nettie
in the course of the Christmas week, which
comforted her a little, and perhaps quieted
Mr. Mathieson too. He brought with him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
on coming home to supper one evening, a
great thick roll of a bundle, and put it in
Nettie's arms, telling her that was for her
New Year.</p>

<p>"For me!" said Nettie, the colour starting
a little into her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Yes, for you. Open it, and see."</p>

<p>So Nettie did, with some trouble, and
there tumbled out upon the floor a great
heavy warm blanket, new from the shop.
Mr. Mathieson thought the pink in her
cheeks was the prettiest thing he had seen
in a long while.</p>

<p>"Is this for <em>me</em>, father?"</p>

<p>"I mean it to be so. See if it will go on
that bed of yours and keep you warm."</p>

<p>Nettie gave her father some very hearty
thanks, which he took in a silent, pleased
way; and then she hastened off with her
blanket upstairs. How thick and warm it
was! and how nicely it would keep her comfortable
when she knelt, all wrapped up in it,
on that cold floor. For a little while it
would; not even a warm blanket would keep
her from the cold more than a little while at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a time up there. But Nettie tried its powers
the first thing she did.</p>

<p>Did Mr. Mathieson mean the blanket to
take the place of his promise? Nettie
thought of that, but like a wise child she
said nothing at all till the Sunday morning
came. Then, before she set off for Sunday-school,
she came to her father's elbow.</p>

<p>"Father, I'll be home a quarter after ten;
will you be ready then?"</p>

<p>"Ready for what?" said Mr. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"For my New Year's," said Nettie. "You
know you promised I should go to church
with you."</p>

<p>"Did I? And aint you going to take the
blanket for your New Year's, and let me off,
Nettie?"</p>

<p>"No, father, to be sure not. I'll be home
at a quarter past; please don't forget." And
Nettie went off to school very thankful and
happy, for her father's tone was not unkind.
How glad she was New Year's day had come
on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson was as good as his word.
He was ready at the time, and they walked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to the church together. That was a great
day to Nettie. Her father and mother going
to church in company with her and with each
other. But nobody that saw her sober sweet
little face would have guessed how very full
her heart was of prayer, even as they walked
along the street among the rest of the people.
And when they got to church, it seemed as
if every word of the prayers and of the reading
and of the hymns and of the sermon,
struck on all Nettie's nerves of hearing and
feeling. Would her father understand any
of those sweet words? would he feel them?
would they reach him? Nettie little thought
that what he felt most, what <em>did</em> reach him,
though he did not thoroughly understand it,
was the look of her own face; though she
never but once dared turn it toward him.
There was a little colour in it more than
usual; her eye was deep in its earnestness;
and the grave set of her little mouth was
broken up now and then in a way that Mr.
Mathieson wanted to watch better than the
straight sides of her sun-bonnet would let him.
Once he thought he saw something more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
He walked home very soberly, and was a
good deal on the silent order during the rest
of the day. He did not go to church in
the afternoon. But in the evening, as
her mother was busy in and out getting
supper ready, and Mr. Lumber had not
come in, Mr. Mathieson called Nettie to his
side.</p>

<p>"What was you crying for in church this
forenoon?" he said, low.</p>

<p>"Crying!" said Nettie, surprised. "Was
I crying?"</p>

<p>"If it wasn't tears I saw dropping from
under your hands on to the floor, it must
have been some drops of rain that had got
there, and I don't see how they could very
well. There warn't no rain outside. What
was it for, hey?"</p>

<p>There came a great flush all over Nettie's
face, and she did not at once speak.</p>

<p>"Hey?&mdash;what was it for?"&mdash;repeated Mr.
Mathieson.</p>

<p>The flush passed away. Nettie spoke very
low and with lips all of a quiver. "I remember.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
I was thinking, father, how 'all
things are ready'&mdash;and I couldn't help
wishing that you were ready too."</p>

<p>"Ready for what?" said Mr. Mathieson,
somewhat roughly. "All things ready for
what?"</p>

<p>"Ready for you," said Nettie. "Jesus is
ready to love you, and calls you&mdash;and the
angels are ready to rejoice for you&mdash;and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on! What of you?"</p>

<p>Nettie lifted her eyes to him. "I am
ready to rejoice too, father." But the time
of rejoicing was not yet. Nettie burst into
tears.</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson was not angry, yet he flung
away from her with a rude "Pshaw!" and
that was all the answer she got. But the
truth was, that there was something in
Nettie's look, of tenderness, and purity, and
trembling hope, that her father's heart could
not bear to meet; and what is more, that he
was never able to forget.</p>

<p>Nettie went about her evening business
helping her mother, and keeping back the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
tears which were very near again; and Mr.
Mathieson began to talk with Mr. Lumber,
and everything was to all appearance just as
it had been hitherto. And so it went on
after that.</p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE HOUSE-RAISING.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h3>


<p>It grew colder and colder in Nettie's garret&mdash;or
else she grew thinner and felt it more.
She certainly thought it was colder. The
snow came, and piled a thick covering on the
roof and stopped up some of the chinks in the
clapboarding with its white caulking; and
that made the place a little better; then the
winds from off the snow-covered country were
keen and bitter.</p>

<p>Nettie's whole day was so busy that she
had little time to think, except when she
went upstairs at night; covered up there
under her blankets and quilts, and looking
up at the stars, she used to feel sadly that
things were in a very bad way. Her father
was out constantly o' nights, and they knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
too surely where he spent them. He was
not a confirmed drunkard yet; but how long
would it take, at this rate? And that man
Lumber leading him on, with a thicker head
himself, and Barry following after! No
seeming thought nor care for his wife and
daughter and their comfort; it was with
great difficulty they could get from him
enough money for their daily needs; and to
make that do, Nettie and her mother pinched
and starved themselves. Often and often
Nettie went to bed with an empty stomach,
because she was not hearty enough to eat
porridge or pork, and the men had not left
enough of other viands for herself and her
mother. And neither of them would pretend
to want that little there was, for fear the
other wanted it more.</p>

<p>Her mother was patient and quiet now;
not despairing, as a few months ago; and
that was such joy to Nettie that she felt often
much more like giving thanks than complaining.
Yet she saw her mother toiling and
insufficiently cared for, and she went to bed
feeling very poor and thin herself; then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Nettie used to look at the stars and remember
the Lord's promises and the golden
city, till at last she would go to sleep upon
her pillow feeling the very richest little child
in all the country. "They shall not be
ashamed that wait for me"&mdash;was one word
which was very often the last in her thoughts.
Nettie had no comfort from her father in all
the time between New Year and spring.
Except one word.</p>

<p>One morning she went to Barry secretly in
his room, and asked him to bring the pail of
water from the spring for her. Barry had no
mind to the job.</p>

<p>"Why can't mother do it?" he said, "if
you can't?"</p>

<p>"Mother is busy and hasn't a minute. I
always do it for her."</p>

<p>"Well, why can't you go on doing it?
you're accustomed to it, you see, and I don't
like going out so early," said Barry, stretching
himself.</p>

<p>"I would, and I wouldn't ask you; only,
Barry, somehow I don't think I'm quite
strong lately and I can hardly bring the pail,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
it's so heavy to me. I have to stop and rest
ever so many times before I can get to the
house with it."</p>

<p>"Well, if you stop and rest, I suppose it
wont hurt you," said Barry. "<em>I</em> should want
to stop and rest, too, myself."</p>

<p>His little sister was turning away, giving
it up; when she was met by her father who
stepped in from the entry. He looked red
with anger.</p>

<p>"You take the pail and go get the water!"
said he to his son; "and you hear me! don't
you let Nettie bring in another pailful when
you're at home, or I'll turn you out of the
house. You lazy scoundrel! You don't deserve
the bread you eat. Would you let her
work for you, when you are as strong as
sixty?"</p>

<p>Barry's grumbled words in answer were so
very unsatisfactory, that Mr. Mathieson in a
rage advanced toward him with uplifted fist;
but Nettie sprang in between and very nearly
caught the blow that was meant for her
brother.</p>

<p>"Please, father, don't!" she cried; "please,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
father, don't be angry. Barry didn't think&mdash;he
didn't"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why didn't he?" said Mr. Mathieson.
"Great lazy rascal! He wants to be flogged."</p>

<p>"Oh don't!" said Nettie,&mdash;"he didn't
know why I asked him, or he wouldn't have
refused me."</p>

<p>"Why did you, then?"</p>

<p>"Because it made my back ache so to
bring it, I couldn't help asking him."</p>

<p>"Did you ever ask him before?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, please, father!" said Nettie,
sweetly. "Just don't think about me, and don't
be angry with Barry. It's no matter now."</p>

<p>"Who does think about you? Your
mother don't, or she would have seen to this
before."</p>

<p>"Mother didn't know my back ached.
Father, you know she hasn't a minute, she
is so busy getting breakfast in time; and
she didn't know I wasn't strong enough.
Father, don't tell her, please, I asked Barry.
It would worry her so. Please don't, father."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> think of folks, anyhow. You're a
regular peacemaker!" exclaimed Mr. Mathieson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
as he turned away and left her. Nettie
stood still, the flush paling on her cheek, her
hand pressed to her side.</p>

<p>"Am I that?" she thought. "Shall I be
that? Oh Lord, my Saviour, my dear
Redeemer, send thy peace here!"&mdash;She was
still in the same place and position when
Barry came in again.</p>

<p>"It's wretched work!" he exclaimed,
under his breath, for his father was in the
next room. "It's as slippery as the plague,
going down that path to the water&mdash;it's no
use to have legs, for you can't hold up. I'm
all froze stiff with the water I've spilled
on me!"</p>

<p>"I know it's very slippery," said Nettie.</p>

<p>"And then you can't get at the water
when you're there, without stepping into it&mdash;it's
filled chuck full of snow and ice all over
the edge. It's the most wretched work!"</p>

<p>"I know it, Barry," said Nettie. "I am
sorry you have to do it."</p>

<p>"What did you make me do it for, then?"
said he, angrily. "You got it your own way
this time, but never mind,&mdash;I'll be up with
you for it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
"Barry," said his sister, "please do it just
a little while for me, till I get stronger, and
don't mind; and as soon as ever I can I'll
do it again. But you don't know how it
made me ache all through, bringing the pail
up that path."</p>

<p>"Stuff!" said Barry. And from that time,
though he did not fail to bring the water in
the morning, yet Nettie saw he owed her a
grudge for it all the day afterward. He
was almost always away with his father, and
she had little chance to win him to better
feeling.</p>

<p>So the winter slowly passed and the spring
came. Spring months came, at least; and
now and then to be sure a sweet spring day,
when all nature softened; the sun shone
mildly, the birds sang, the air smelled sweet
with the opening buds. Those days were
lovely, and Nettie enjoyed them no one can
tell how much. On her walk to school, it
was so pleasant to be able to step slowly and
not hasten to be out of the cold; and Nettie's
feet did not feel ready for quick work now-a-days.
It was so pleasant to hear the
sparrows and other small birds, and to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
them, with their cheery voices and sonsy
little heads, busy and happy. And the soft
air was very reviving too.</p>

<p>Then at home the work was easier, a great
deal; and in Nettie's garret the change was
wonderful. There came hours when she
could sit on the great chest under her window
and look out, or kneel there and pray, without
danger of catching her death of cold; and
instead of that, the balmy perfumed spring
breeze coming into her window, and the
trees budding, and the grass on the fields
and hills beginning to look green, and the
sunlight soft and vapoury. Such an hour&mdash;or
quarter of an hour&mdash;to Nettie was worth
a great deal. Her weary little frame seemed
to rest in it, and her mind rested too. For
those days were full not only of the goodness
of God, but of the promise of his goodness.
Nettie read it, and thanked him. Yet things
in the household were no better.</p>

<p>One evening Nettie and her mother were
sitting alone together. They were usually
alone in the evenings, though not usually
sitting down quietly with no work on hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Nettie had her Sunday-school lesson, and
was busy with that, on one side of the fire.
Mrs. Mathieson on the other side sat and
watched her. After a while Nettie looked
up and saw her mother's gaze, no longer on
her, fixed mournfully on the fire and looking
through that at something else. Nettie read
the look, and answered it after her own
fashion. She closed her book and sang, to a
very, very sweet, plaintive air,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I heard the voice of Jesus say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Come unto me and rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">Lay down, thou weary one, lay down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy head upon my breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">I came to Jesus as I was,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Weary, and worn, and sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i1a">I found in him a resting-place,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>She sang two verses, clear, glad, and sweet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
as Nettie always sang; then she paused and
looked at her mother.</p>

<p>"Do you keep up hope yet, Nettie?"
said Mrs. Mathieson, sadly.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," Nettie said, quietly.</p>

<p>"Mine gets beat out sometimes," said Mrs.
Mathieson, drooping her head for an instant
on her hands. "Your father's out every
night now; and you know where he goes;
and he cares less and less about anything
else in the world but Jackson's store, and
what he gets there, and the company he finds
there. And he don't want much of being a
ruined man."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother. But the Bible says we
must wait on the Lord."</p>

<p>"Wait! yes, and I've waited; and I see
you growing as thin as a shadow and
as weak as a mouse; and your father
don't see it; and he's let you sleep in that
cold place up there all winter just to accommodate
that Lumber!&mdash;I am sure he is well
named."</p>

<p>"O mother, my garret is nice now,&mdash;on
the warm days. You can't think how pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
it is out of my window&mdash;prettier than any
window in the house."</p>

<p>"Outside, I dare say. It isn't a place
fit for a cat to sleep on!"</p>

<p>"Mother, it's a good place to me. I don't
want a better place. I don't think anybody
else has a place that seems so good to me;
for mother, Jesus is always there."</p>

<p>"I expect there'll be nothing else but
heaven good enough for you after it!" said
Mrs. Mathieson, with a sort of half sob. "I
see you wasting away before my very eyes."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Nettie, cheerfully, "how
can you talk so? I feel well&mdash;except now
and then."</p>

<p>"If your father could only be made to see
it!&mdash;but he can't see anything, nor hear
anything. There's that house-raising to-morrow,
Nettie&mdash;it's been on my mind this
fortnight past, and it kills me."</p>

<p>"Why, mother?"</p>

<p>"I know how it will be," said Mrs. Mathieson;
"they'll have a grand set-to after they
get it up; and your father'll be in the first of
it; and I somehow feel as if it would be the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
finishing of him. I wish almost he'd get
sick&mdash;or anything, to keep him away. They
make such a time after a house-raising."</p>

<p>"O mother, don't wish that," said Nettie;
but she began to think how it would be
possible to withdraw her father from the
frolic with which the day's business would be
ended. Mr. Mathieson was a carpenter, and
a fine workman; and always had plenty of
work and was much looked up to among his
fellows.</p>

<p>Nettie began to think whether <em>she</em> could
make any effort to keep her father from the
dangers into which he was so fond of plunging;
hitherto she had done nothing but pray
for him; could she do anything more, with
any chance of good coming of it? She thought
and thought; and resolved that she must try.
It did not look hopeful; there was little she
could urge to lure Mr. Mathieson from his
drinking companions; nothing, except her
own timid affection, and the one other thing
it was possible to offer him,&mdash;a good supper.
How to get that was not so easy; but she
consulted with her mother.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Mrs. Mathieson said she used in her younger
days to know how to make waffles,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Mr.
Mathieson used to think they were the best
things that ever were made; now if Mrs.
Moss, a neighbour, would lend her waffle-iron,
and she could get a few eggs,&mdash;she
believed she could manage it still. "But we
haven't the eggs, child," she said; "and I
don't believe any power under heaven can
get him to come away from that raising
frolic."</p>

<p>Nor did Nettie. It was to no power
<em>under</em> heaven that she trusted. But she
must use her means. She easily got the
iron from Mrs. Moss. Then she borrowed
the eggs from Mme. Auguste, who in Lent
time always had them; then she watched
with grave eyes and many a heart prayer
the while, the mixing and making of the
waffles.</p>

<p>"How do you manage the iron, mother?"</p>

<p>"Why it is made hot," said Mrs. Mathieson,
"very hot, and buttered; and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
when the batter is light you pour it in, and
clap it together, and put it in the stove."</p>

<p>"But how can you pour it in, mother? I
don't see how you can fill the iron."</p>

<p>"Why, you can't, child; you fill one half,
and shut it together: and when it bakes
it rises up and fills the other half. You'll
see."</p>

<p>The first thing Nettie asked when she
came home from school in the afternoon
was, if the waffles were light? She never
saw any look better, Mrs. Mathieson said;
"but I forgot, child, we ought to have cinnamon
and white sugar to eat on them;&mdash;it
was so that your father used to admire
them; they wont be waffles without sugar
and cinnamon, I'm afraid he'll think;&mdash;but
I don't believe you'll get him home to think
anything about them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson ended with a sigh. Nettie
said nothing; she went round the room,
putting it in particularly nice order; then
set the table. When all that was right, she
went up to her garret, and knelt down and
prayed that God would take care of her and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
bless her errand. She put the whole matter
in the Lord's hands; then she dressed herself
in her hood and cloak and went down to her
mother. Mr. Mathieson had not come home
to dinner, being busy with the house-raising;
so they had had no opportunity to invite
him, and Nettie was now on her way to
do it.</p>

<p>"It's turned a bad afternoon; I'm afraid
it aint fit for you to go, Nettie."</p>

<p>"I don't mind," said Nettie. "May be I'll
get some sugar and cinnamon, mother, before
I come back."</p>

<p>"Well, you know where the raising is?
it's out on the Shallonway road, on beyond
Mrs. August's, a good bit."</p>

<p>Nettie nodded, and went out; and as the
door closed on her grave, sweet little face,
Mrs. Mathieson felt a great strain on her
heart. She would have been glad to relieve
herself by tears, but it was a dry pain that
would not be relieved so. She went to the
window, and looked out at the weather.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE WAFFLES.</h3>


<p>The early part of the day had been brilliant
and beautiful; then, March-like, it had
changed about, gathered up a whole sky-full
of clouds, and turned at last to snowing.
The large feathery flakes were falling now,
fast; melting as fast as they fell; making
everything wet and chill, in the air and under
the foot. Nettie had no overshoes; she was
accustomed to get her feet wet very often, so
that was nothing new. She hugged herself
in her brown cloak, on which the beautiful
snowflakes rested white a moment and then
melted away, gradually wetting the covering
of her arms and shoulders in a way that
would reach through by and by. Nettie
thought little of it. What was she thinking
of? She was comforting herself with the
thought of that strong and blessed Friend
who has promised to be always with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
servants; and remembering his promise&mdash;"they
shall not be ashamed that wait for
me." What did the snow and the wet matter
to Nettie? Yet she looked too much like a
snow-flake herself when she reached Mr.
Jackson's store and went in. The white
frosting had lodged all round her old black
silk hood and even edged the shoulders of
her brown cloak; and the white little face
within looked just as pure.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson looked at her with more than
usual attention; and when Nettie asked him
if he would let her have a shilling's worth of
fine white sugar and cinnamon, and trust her
till the next week for the money, he made
not the slightest difficulty; but measured or
weighed it out for her directly, and even said
he would trust her for more than that. So
Nettie thanked him, and went on to the less
easy part of her errand. Her heart began
to beat a little bit now.</p>

<p>The feathery snowflakes fell thicker and
made everything wetter than ever; it was
very raw and chill, and few people were
abroad. Nettie went on, past the little bakewoman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
house, and past all the thickly built
part of the village. Then came houses more
scattered; large handsome houses with beautiful
gardens and grounds and handsome
garden palings along the roadside. Past one
or two of these, and then there was a space
of wild ground; and here Mr. Jackson was
putting up a new house for himself, and
meant to have a fine place. The wild bushes
grew in a thick hedge along by the fence,
but over the tops of them Nettie could see
the new timbers of the frame that the carpenters
had been raising that day. She went
on till she came to an opening in the hedge
and fence as well, and then the new building
was close before her. The men were at work
yet, finishing their day's business; the sound
of hammering rung sharp on all sides of the
frame; some were up on ladders, some were
below. Nettie walked slowly up and then
round the place, searching for her father. At
last she found him. He and Barry, who was
learning his father's trade, were on the ground
at one side of the frame, busy as bees.
Talking was going on roundly too, as well as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
hammering, and Nettie drew near and stood
a few minutes without any one noticing her.
She was not in a hurry to interrupt the work
nor to tell her errand; she waited.</p>

<p>Barry saw her first, but ungraciously would
not speak to her nor for her. If she was
there for anything, he said to himself, it was
for some spoil-sport; and one pail of water
a day was enough for him. Mr. Mathieson
was looking the other way.</p>

<p>"I say, Mathieson," called one of the men
from the inside of the frame, "I s'pose 'taint
worth carrying any of this stuff&mdash;Jackson'll
have enough without it?" The words were
explained to Nettie's horror by a jug in the
man's hands, which he lifted to his lips.</p>

<p>"Jackson will do something handsome in
that way to-night," said Nettie's father; "or
he'll not do as he's done by, such a confounded
wet evening. But I've stood to my word,
and I expect he'll stand to his'n."</p>

<p>"He gave his word there was to be oysters,
warn't it?" called another man from the top
of the ladder.</p>

<p>"Punch and oysters," said Mathieson, hammering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
away, "or I've raised the last frame
I ever <em>will</em> raise, for him. I expect he'll
stand it."</p>

<p>"Oysters aint much count," said another
speaker. "I'd rather have a slice of good
sweet pork any day."</p>

<p>"Father," said Nettie. She had come
close up to him, but she trembled. What
possible chance could she have?</p>

<p>"Hollo!" said Mr. Mathieson, turning suddenly.
"Nettie!&mdash;what's to pay, girl?"</p>

<p>He spoke roughly, and Nettie saw that his
face was red. She trembled all over, but she
spoke as bravely as she could.</p>

<p>"Father, I am come to invite you home to
supper to-night. Mother and I have a particular
reason to want to see you. Will you
come?"</p>

<p>"Come where?" said Mr. Mathieson, but
half understanding her.</p>

<p>"Come home to tea, father. I came to
ask you. Mother has made something you
like."</p>

<p>"I'm busy, child. Go home. I'm going
to supper at Jackson's. Go home." He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
turned to his hammering again. But Nettie
stood still in the snow and waited.</p>

<p>"Father&mdash;" she said, after a minute,
coming yet closer and speaking more low.</p>

<p>"What? Aint you gone?" exclaimed Mr.
Mathieson.</p>

<p>"Father," said Nettie, softly, "mother has
made waffles for you,&mdash;and you used to
like them so much, she says; and they are
light and beautiful and just ready to bake.
Wont you come and have them with us?
Mother says they'll be very nice."</p>

<p>"Why didn't she make 'em another time,"
grumbled Barry,&mdash;"when we weren't going
to punch and oysters? That's a better
game!"</p>

<p>If Mathieson had not been drinking he
might have been touched by the sight of
Nettie; so very white and delicate her little
face looked, trembling and eager, within that
border of her black hood on which the snow
crystals lay, a very doubtful and unwholesome
embroidery. She looked as if she was
going to melt and disappear like one of them;
and perhaps Mr. Mathieson did feel the effect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of her presence, but he felt it only to be vexed
and irritated; and Barry's suggestion fell into
ready ground.</p>

<p>"I tell you, go home!" he said, roughly.
"What are you doing here? I tell you I'm
<em>not</em> coming home&mdash;I'm engaged to supper to-night,
and I'm not going to miss it for any
fool's nonsense. Go home!"</p>

<p>Nettie's lip trembled, but that was all the
outward show of the agitation within. She
would not have delayed to obey, if her father
had been quite himself; in his present condition
she thought perhaps the next word
might undo the last; she could not go
without another trial. She waited an instant
and again said softly and pleadingly,
"Father, I've been and got cinnamon and
sugar for you,&mdash;all ready."</p>

<p>"Cinnamon and sugar"&mdash;he cursed with a
great oath; and turning gave Nettie a violent
push from him, that was half a blow. "Go
home!" he repeated&mdash;"go home! and mind
your business; and don't take it upon you to
mind mine."</p>

<p>Nettie reeled, staggered, and coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
blindly against one or two timbers that lay
on the ground, she fell heavily over them.
Nobody saw her. Mr. Mathieson had not
looked after giving her the push, and Barry
had gone over to help somebody who called
him. Nettie felt dizzy and sick; but she
picked herself up, and wet and downhearted
took the road home again. She was sadly
downhearted. Her little bit of a castle in the
air had tumbled all to pieces; and what was
more, it had broken down upon her. A hope,
faint indeed, but a hope, had kept her up
through all her exertions that day; she felt
very feeble, now the hope was gone; and
that her father should have laid a rough hand
on her, hurt her sorely. It hurt her bitterly;
he had never done so before; and the cause
why he came to do it now, rather made it
more sorrowful than less so to Nettie's mind.</p>

<p>She could not help a few salt tears from
falling; and for a moment Nettie's faith
trembled. Feeling weak, and broken, and
miserable, the thought came coldly across her
mind, <em>would</em> the Lord not hear her, after all?
It was but a moment of faith-trembling, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
it made her sick. There was more to do
that; the push and fall over the timbers had
jarred her more than she knew at the moment.
Nettie walked slowly back upon her
road till she neared the shop of Mme.
Auguste; then she felt herself growing very
ill, and just reached the Frenchwoman's door
to faint away on her steps.</p>

<p>She did not remain there two seconds.
Mme. Auguste had seen her go by an hour
before, and now sat at her window looking
out to amuse herself, but with a special
intent to see and waylay that pale child on
her repassing the house. She saw the little
black hood reappear, and started to open the
door, just in time to see Nettie fall down at
her threshold. As instantly two willing arms
were put under her, and lifted up the child
and bore her into the house. Then Madame
took off her hood, touched her lips with
brandy and her brow with cologne water, and
chafed her hands. She had lain Nettie on
the floor of the inner room and put a pillow
under her head; the strength which had
brought her so far having failed there, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
proved unequal to lift her again and put her
on the bed. Nettie presently came to, opened
her eyes, and looked at her nurse.</p>

<p>"Why, my Nettie," said the little woman,
"what is this, my child? what is the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Nettie, scarce over
her breath.</p>

<p>"Do you feel better now, <em>mon enfant</em>?"</p>

<p>Nettie did not, and did not speak. Mme.
Auguste mixed a spoonful of brandy and
water and made her take it. That revived
her a little.</p>

<p>"I must get up and go home," were the
first words she said.</p>

<p>"You will lie still there, till I get some
person to lift you on the bed," said the
Frenchwoman, decidedly. "I have not more
strength than a fly. What ails you, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Take one spoonful more. What did you
have for dinner to-day?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But I must go home!"
said Nettie, trying to raise herself. "Mother
will want me&mdash;she'll want me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
"You will lie still, like a good child," said
her friend, gently putting her back on her
pillow;&mdash;"and I will find some person to
carry you home&mdash;or some person what will
bring your mother here. I will go see if I
can find some one now. You lie still,
Nettie."</p>

<p>Nettie lay still, feeling weak after that exertion
of trying to raise herself. She was
quite restored now, and her first thoughts
were of grief, that she had for a moment, and
under any discouragement, failed to trust fully
the Lord's promises. She trusted them now.
Let her father do what he would, let things
look as dark as they might, Nettie felt sure
that "the rewarder of them that diligently
seek him" had a blessing in store for her.
Bible words, sweet and long loved and rested
on, came to her mind, and Nettie rested on
them with perfect rest. "For he hath not
despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from
him; but when he cried unto him, <em>he heard</em>."
"Our heart shall rejoice in him, <em>because we
have trusted in his holy name</em>." Prayer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
for forgiveness, and a thanksgiving of great
peace, filled Nettie's heart all the while the
Frenchwoman was gone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mme. Auguste had been looking
into the street, and seeing nobody out in
the wet snow, she rushed back to Nettie.
Nettie was like herself now, only very pale.</p>

<p>"I must have cut my lip somehow," she
said; "there's blood on my handkerchief.
How did I come in here?"</p>

<p>"Blood!" said the Frenchwoman,&mdash;"where
did you cut yourself, Nettie? Let me
look!"</p>

<p>Which she did, with a face so anxious and
eager that Nettie smiled at her. Her own
brow was as quiet and placid as ever it was.</p>

<p>"How did I get in here, Mrs. August?"</p>

<p>The Frenchwoman, however, did not answer
her. Instead of which she went to her cupboard
and got a cup and spoon, and then
from a little saucepan on the stove dipped
out some riz-au-gras again.</p>

<p>"What did you have for dinner, Nettie?
you did not tell me."</p>

<p>"Not much&mdash;I wasn't hungry," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Nettie. "O, I must get up and go home to
mother."</p>

<p>"You shall eat something first," said her
friend; and she raised Nettie's head upon
another pillow, and began to feed her with
the spoon. "It is good for you. You must
take it. Where is your father? Don't talk,
but tell me. I will do everything right."</p>

<p>"He is at work on Mr. Jackson's new
house."</p>

<p>"Is he there to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Mme. Auguste gave her all the "broth"
in the cup, then bade her keep still, and
went to the shop window. It was time for
the men to be quitting work, she knew; she
watched for the carpenters to come. If they
were not gone by already!&mdash;how should she
know? Even as she thought this, a sound
of rude steps and men's voices came from
down the road; and the Frenchwoman
went to her door and opened it. The
men came along, a scattered group of four or
five.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Mat'ieson there?" she said. Mme.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Auguste hardly knew him by sight. "Men,
I say! is Mr. Mat'ieson there?"</p>

<p>"George, that's you; you're wanted," said
one of the group, looking back; and a fine-looking,
tall man paused at Madame's
threshold.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Mat'ieson?" said the Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. That's my name."</p>

<p>"Will you come in? I have something
to speak to you. Your little daughter
Nettie is very sick."</p>

<p>"Sick!" exclaimed the man. "Nettie!&mdash;Where
is she?"</p>

<p>"She is here. Hush! you must not say
nothing to her, but she is very sick. She is
come fainting at my door, and I have got
her in here; but she wants to go home, and
I think you had better tell her she will not
go home, but she will stay here with me to-night."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" said Mr. Mathieson; and
he stepped in with so little ceremony that
the mistress of the house gave way before
him. He looked round the shop.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
"She is not here&mdash;you shall see her&mdash;but
you must not tell her she is sick," said the
Frenchwoman, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" repeated Mr. Mathieson,
with a tone and look which made Mme.
Auguste afraid he would burst the doors if
she did not open them. She opened the
inner door without further preparation, and
Mr. Mathieson walked in. By the fading
light he saw Nettie lying on the floor at his
feet. He was thoroughly himself now; sobered
in more ways than one. He stood
still when he had got there, and spoke not a
word.</p>

<p>"Father," said Nettie, softly.</p>

<p>He stooped down over her. "What do
you want, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Can't I go home?"</p>

<p>"She must better not go home to-night!"
began Mme. Auguste, earnestly. "It is so
wet and cold! She will stay here with me
to-night, Mr. Mat'ieson. You will tell her
that it is best."</p>

<p>But Nettie said, "<em>Please</em> let me go home!
mother will be so troubled." She spoke little,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
for she felt weak; but her father saw her
very eager in the request. He stooped and
put his strong arms under her, and lifted her
up.</p>

<p>"Have you got anything you can put over
her?" he said, looking round the room. "I'll
fetch it back."</p>

<p>Seeing that the matter was quite taken
out of her hands, the kind little Frenchwoman
was very quick in her arrangements.
She put on Nettie's head a warm hood of
her own; then round her and over her
she wrapped a thick woollen counterpane,
that to be sure would have let no snow
through if the distance to be travelled had
been twice as far. As she folded and arranged
the thick stuff round Nettie's head, so as to
shield even her face from the outer air, she
said, half whispering&mdash;</p>

<p>"I would not tell nothing to mother about
your lip; it is not much. I wish I could
keep you. Now she is ready, Mr. Mat'ieson."</p>

<p>And Mr. Mathieson stalked out of the
house, and strode along the road with firm,
swift steps, till, past Jackson's, and past the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
turning, he came to his own door, and carried
Nettie upstairs. He never said a word the
whole way. Nettie was too muffled up, and
too feeble to speak; so the first word was
when he had come in and sat down in a
chair, which he did with Nettie still in his
arms. Mrs. Mathieson, standing white and
silent, waited to see what was the matter;
she had no power to ask a question. Her
husband unfolded the counterpane that was
wrapped round Nettie's head; and there she
was, looking very like her usual self, only
exceedingly pale. As soon as she caught
sight of her mother's face, Nettie would have
risen and stood up, but her father's arms
held her fast. "What do you want, Nettie?"
he asked. It was the first word.</p>

<p>"Nothing, father," said Nettie, "only lay
me on the bed, please; and then you and
mother have supper."</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson took her to the bed and
laid her gently down, removing the snow-wet
counterpane which was round her.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" faltered Mrs.
Mathieson.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
"Nothing much, mother," said Nettie,
quietly; "only I was a little sick. Wont
you bake the waffles and have supper?"</p>

<p>"What will <em>you</em> have?" said her father.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;I've had something. I feel
nicely now," said Nettie. "Mother, wont
you have supper, and let me see you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson's strength had well-nigh
deserted her; but Nettie's desire was urgent,
and seeing that her husband had seated himself
by the bedside, and seemed to have no
idea of being anywhere but at home that
evening, she at length gathered up her faculties
to do what was the best thing to be
done, and went about preparing the supper.
Nettie's eyes watched her, and Mr. Mathieson
when he thought himself safe watched <em>her</em>.
He did not look like the same man, so
changed and sobered was the expression of
his face. Mrs. Mathieson was devoured by
fear, even in observing this; but Nettie was
exceedingly happy. She did not feel anything
but weakness: and she lay on her
pillow watching the waffles baked and
sugared, and then watching them eaten,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
wondering and rejoicing within herself at the
way in which her father had been brought to
eat his supper there at home after all. She
was the only one that enjoyed anything,
though her father and mother ate to please
her. Mrs. Mathieson had asked an account
of Nettie's illness, and got a very unsatisfactory
one. She had been faint, her husband
said; he had found her at Mrs.
August's and brought her home; that was
about all. After supper he came and sat by
Nettie again; and said she was to sleep
there, and he would go up and take Nettie's
place in the attic. Nettie in vain said she
was well enough to go upstairs; her father
cut the question short, and bade Mrs.
Mathieson go up and get anything Nettie
wanted. When she had left the room, he
stooped his head down to Nettie and said
low&mdash;</p>

<p>"What was that about your lip?"</p>

<p>Nettie started; she thought he would
fancy it had been done, if done at all, when
he gave her the push at the frame-house.
But she did not, dare not, answer. She said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
it was only that she had found a little blood
on her handkerchief, and supposed she might
have cut her lip when she fell on Mrs. August's
threshold, when she had fainted.</p>

<p>"Show me your handkerchief," said her
father. Nettie obeyed. He looked at it,
and looked close at her lips, to find where
they might have been wounded; and Nettie
was sorry to see how much he felt, for he
even looked pale himself as he turned away
from her. But he was as gentle and kind as
he could be; Nettie had never seen him so;
and when he went off up to bed and Nettie
was drawn into her mother's arms to go to
sleep, she was very, very happy. But she did
not tell her hopes or her joys to her mother;
she only told her thanks to the Lord; and
that she did till she fell asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning Nettie was well enough
to get up and dress herself. That was all
she was suffered to do by father or mother.
Mr. Mathieson sent Barry for water and
wood, and himself looked after the fire while
Mrs. Mathieson was busy; all the rest he did
was to take Nettie in his arms and sit holding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
her till breakfast was ready. He did not
talk, and he kept Barry quiet; he was like a
different man. Nettie, feeling indeed very
weak, could only sit with her head on her
father's shoulder, and wonder, and think, and
repeat quiet prayers in her heart. She was
very pale yet, and it distressed Mr. Mathieson
to see that she could not eat. So he laid
her on the bed, when he was going to his
work, and told her she was to stay there and
be still, and he would bring her something
good when he came home.</p>

<p>The day was strangely long and quiet to
Nettie. Instead of going to school and flying
about at home doing all sorts of things, she
lay on the bed and followed her mother with
her eyes as she moved about the room at her
work. The eyes often met Mrs. Mathieson's
eyes; and once Nettie called her mother to
her bedside.</p>

<p>"Mother, what is the matter with you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson stood still, and had some
trouble to speak. At last she told Nettie
she was sorry to see her lying there and not
able to be up and around.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
"Mother," said Nettie, expressively,&mdash;"'There
is rest for the weary.'"</p>

<p>"O Nettie," said her mother, beginning to
cry,&mdash;"you are all I have got!&mdash;my blessed
one!"</p>

<p>"Hush, mother," said Nettie; "<em>I</em> am not
your blessed one,&mdash;you forget; and I am not
all you have got. Where is Jesus, mother?
O mother, 'rest in the Lord!'"</p>

<p>"I don't deserve to," said Mrs. Mathieson,
trying to stop her tears.</p>

<p>"I feel very well," Nettie went on; "only
weak, but I shall be well directly. And I
am so happy, mother. Wont you go on and
get dinner? and mother, just do that;&mdash;'rest
in the Lord.'"</p>

<p>Nettie was not able to talk much, and
Mrs. Mathieson checked herself and went on
with her work, as she begged. When her
father came home at night he was as good
as his word, and brought home some fresh
oysters, that he thought would tempt Nettie's
appetite; but it was much more to her that
he stayed quietly at home and never made a
move toward going out. Eating was not in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Nettie's line just now; the little kind Frenchwoman
had been to see her in the course of
the day and brought some delicious rolls and
a jug of <em>riz-au-gras</em>, which was what seemed
to suit Nettie's appetite best of all.</p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<h3>THE GOLDEN CITY.</h3>


<p>Several days went on; she did not feel
sick, and she was a little stronger; but appetite
and colour were wanting. Her father
would not let her do anything; he would
not let her go up to her garret to sleep,
though Nettie pleaded for it, fearing he must
be uncomfortable. He said it was fitter for
him than for her, though he made faces
about it. He always came home and stayed
at home now, and especially attended to
Nettie; his wages came home too, and he
brought every day something to try to tempt
her to eat; and he was quiet and grave and
kind&mdash;not the same person.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson in the midst of all her
distress about Nettie began to draw some
free breaths. But her husband thought only
of his child; unless, perhaps, of himself; and
drew none. Regularly after supper he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
would draw Nettie to his arms and sit with
her head on his shoulder; silent generally,
only he would sometimes ask her what
she would like. The first time he put this
inquiry when Mr. Lumber was out of the
way, Nettie answered by asking him to read
to her. Mr. Mathieson hesitated a little, not
unkindly, and then read; a chapter in the
Bible, of course, for Nettie wished to hear
nothing else. And after that he often read
to her; for Mr. Lumber kept up his old
habits and preferred livelier company, and so
was always out in the evenings.</p>

<p>So several days passed; and when Saturday
came, Mr. Mathieson lost half a day's work
and took a long walk to a farm where the
people kept pigeons; and brought home one
for Nettie's supper. However, she could
fancy but very little of it.</p>

<p>"What shall I do for you?" said her
father. "You go round like a shadow, and
you don't eat much more. What shall I do
that you would like?"</p>

<p>This time there was nobody in the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Nettie lifted her head from his shoulder and
met his eyes.</p>

<p>"If you would come to Jesus, father!"</p>

<p>"What?" said Mr. Mathieson.&mdash;"I don't
know anything about that, Nettie. I aint
fit."</p>

<p>"Jesus will take you anyhow, father, if
you will come."</p>

<p>"We'll talk about that some other time,"
said Mr. Mathieson,&mdash;"when you get well."</p>

<p>"But suppose I don't get well, father?"</p>

<p>"Eh?&mdash;&mdash;" said Mr. Mathieson, startled.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shan't get well," said Nettie,
her quiet, grave face not changing in the
least; "then I shall go to the golden city;
and father, I shall be looking for you till you
come."</p>

<p>Mr. Mathieson did not know how to
answer her; he only groaned.</p>

<p>"Father, will you come?" Nettie repeated,
a little faint streak of colour in her cheeks
showing the earnestness of the feeling at
work. But her words had a mingled accent
of tenderness and hope which was irresistible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
"Yes, Nettie&mdash;if you will show me how,"
her father answered, in a lowered voice.
And Nettie's eye gave one bright flash of
joy. It was as if all her strength had gone
out at that flash, and she was obliged to lean
back on her father's shoulder and wait; joy
seemed to have taken away her breath. He
waited too, without knowing why she did.</p>

<p>"Father, the only thing to do is to come
to Jesus."</p>

<p>"What does that mean, Nettie? You
know I don't know."</p>

<p>"It means, father, that Jesus is holding
out his hand with a promise to you. Now
if you will take the promise,&mdash;that is all."</p>

<p>"What is the promise, Nettie?"</p>

<p>Nettie waited, gathered breath, for the
talk made her heart beat; and then said,
"'This is the promise that he hath promised
us, even eternal life.'"</p>

<p>"How can a sinful man take such a promise?"
said Mr. Mathieson, with suppressed
feeling. "That is for people like you, Nettie,
not me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesus has bought it!" cried Nettie;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
"it's free. It's without price. You may
have it if you'll believe in him and love him,
father. I can't talk."</p>

<p>She had talked too much, or the excitement
had been too strong for her. Her
words were broken off by coughing, and she
remarked that her lip must have bled again.
Her father laid her on the bed, and from
that time for a number of days she was kept
as quiet as possible; for her strength had
failed anew and yet more than at first.</p>

<p>For two weeks she hardly moved from the
bed. But except that she was so very pale,
she did not look very ill; her face wore just
its own patient and happy expression. Her
father would not now let her talk to him;
but he did everything she asked. He read
to her in the Bible; Nettie would turn over
the leaves to the place she wanted, and then
point it out to him with a look of life, and
love, and pleasure, that were like a whole
sermon; and her father read first that sermon
and then the chapter. He went to church
as she asked him; and without her asking
him, after the first Sunday. Nettie stayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
at home on the bed and sang psalms in her
heart.</p>

<p>After those two weeks there was a change
for the better. Nettie felt stronger, looked
more as she used to look, and got up and
even went about a little. The weather was
changing too, now. April days were growing
soft and green; trees budding and grass
freshening up, and birds all alive in the
branches; and above all the air and the
light, the wonderful soft breath of spring
and sunshine of spring, made people forget
that winter had ever been harsh or severe.</p>

<p>Nettie went out and took little walks in
the sun, which seemed to do her good; and
she begged so hard to be allowed to go to
her garret again, that her father took pity
on her; sent Mr. Lumber away, and gave
her her old nice little room on the same
floor with the others. Her mother cleaned
it and put it in order, and Nettie felt too
happy when she found herself mistress of it
again and possessed of a quiet place where
she could read and pray alone. With windows
open, how sweetly the spring walked in there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and made it warm, and bright, and fragrant
too. But Nettie had a tenderness for her
old garret as long as she lived.</p>

<p>"It had got to be full of the Bible, mother,"
she said one day. "You know it was too
cold often to sit up there; so I used to go
to bed and lie awake and think of things,&mdash;at
night when the stars were shining,&mdash;and
in the morning in the moonlight sometimes."</p>

<p>"But how was the garret full of the Bible,
Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I had a way of looking at some part
of the roof or the window when I was thinking;
when I couldn't have the Bible in my
hands."</p>

<p>"Well, how did that make it?"</p>

<p>"Why the words seemed to be all over,
mother. There was one big nail I used
often to be looking at when I was thinking
over texts, and a knot-hole in one of the
wainscot boards; my texts used to seem to
go in and out of that knot-hole. And somehow,
mother, I got so that I hardly ever
opened the shutter without thinking of those
words&mdash;'Open ye the gates, that the righteous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
nation that keepeth the truth may enter in.'
I don't know why, but I used to think of it.
And out of that window I used to see the
stars, and look at the golden city."</p>

<p>"Look at it!" said Mrs. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"In my thoughts, you know, mother. Oh,
mother, how happy we are, that are going to
the city! It seems to me as if all that sunlight
was a curtain let down, and the city is
just on the other side."</p>

<p>It was a lovely spring day, the windows
open, and the country flooded with a soft
misty sunlight, through which the tender
greens of the opening leaf began to appear.
Nettie was lying on the bed in her room, her
mother at work by her side. Mrs. Mathieson
looked at her earnest eyes, and then
wistfully out of the window where they were
gazing.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so much about
it?" she said, at last.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I always do. I used to
think about it last winter, looking out at
the stars. Why, mother, you know Jesus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
is there; how can I help thinking about
it?"</p>

<p>"He is here, too," murmured poor Mrs.
Mathieson.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Nettie, tenderly, "aren't
those good words,&mdash;'He hath not despised
nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted,
neither hath he hid his face from him;
but when he cried unto him, <em>he heard</em>?'
I have thought of those words, very
often."</p>

<p>Nettie wished she could sing, for she had
often seen singing comfort her mother; but
she had not the power to-day. She gave her
the best she could. Her words, however,
constantly carried hurt and healing together
to her mother's mind. But when Nettie
went on to repeat softly the verse of a hymn
that follows, she was soothed, notwithstanding
the hinted meaning in the words. So sweet
was the trust of the hymn, so unruffled the
trust of the speaker. The words were from
a little bit of a book of translations of German
hymns which Mr. Folke, her Sunday-school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
teacher, had brought her, and which was
never out of Nettie's hand.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'As God leads me so my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In faith shall rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No grief nor fear my soul shall part<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From Jesus' breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In sweet belief I know<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What way my life doth go&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Since God permitteth so&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That must be best.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Slowly she said the words, with her usual
sober, placid face; and Mrs. Mathieson was
mute.</p>

<p>For some weeks, as the spring breathed
warmer and warmer, Nettie revived; so
much that her mother at times felt encouraged
about her. Mr. Mathieson was
never deceived. Whether his former neglect
of his child had given him particular keenness
of vision in all that concerned her now,
or for whatever reason, <em>he</em> saw well enough
and saw constantly that Nettie was going to
leave him. There was never a wish of hers
uncared for now; there was not a straw
suffered to lie in her path, that he could
take out of it. He went to church, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
read at home; he changed his behaviour to
her mother as well as to herself, and he
brought Barry to his bearings. What more
did Nettie want?</p>

<p>One Sunday, late in May, Nettie had stayed
at home alone while the rest of the family
were gone to church, the neighbour down
stairs having promised to look after her.
She needed no looking after, though; she
spent her time pleasantly with her Bible
and her hymns, till feeling tired she went to
her room to lie down. The windows were
open; it was a very warm day; the trees
were in leaf, and from her bed Nettie could
only see the sunshine in the leaves, and in
one place through a gap in the trees, a bit
of bright hill-side afar off. The birds sang
merrily, and nothing else sounded at all; it
was very Sabbath stillness. So Nettie lay
till she heard the steps of the church-goers
returning; and presently, after her mother
had been there and gone, her father came
into her room to see her. He kissed her,
and said a few words, and then went to the
window and stood there looking out. Both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
were silent some time, while the birds sang
on.</p>

<p>"Father," said Nettie.</p>

<p>He turned instantly, and asked her what
she wanted.</p>

<p>"Father," said Nettie, "the streets of the
city are all of gold."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, meeting her grave eyes,
"and what then, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Only, I was thinking, if the <em>streets</em> are
gold, how clean must the feet be that walk
on them!"</p>

<p>He knew what her intent eyes meant, and
he sat down by her bedside and laid his face
in his hands. "I am a sinful man, Nettie!"
he said.</p>

<p>"Father, 'this is a faithful saying, that
Jesus Christ came into the world to save
sinners.'"</p>

<p>"I don't deserve he should save me,
Nettie."</p>

<p>"Well, father, ask him to save you, <em>because</em>
you don't deserve it."</p>

<p>"What sort of a prayer would that be?"</p>

<p>"The right one, father; for Jesus does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
deserve it, and for his sake is the only way.
If you deserved it, you wouldn't want Jesus;
but now '<em>he</em> is our peace.' O father listen,
listen, to what the Bible says." She had
been turning the leaves of her Bible, and
read low and earnestly&mdash;"'Now we are ambassadors
for God, as though God did beseech
you by us; we pray you, in Christ's stead,
be ye reconciled to God.' Oh, father, aren't
you willing to be reconciled to him?"</p>

<p>"God knows I am willing!" said Mr.
Mathieson.</p>

<p>"<em>He</em> is willing, I am sure," said Nettie.
"'He was wounded for our transgressions, he
was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement
of our peace was upon him.' He has
made peace; he is the Prince of Peace; he
will give it to you, father."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Mr. Mathieson
never stirred. Nor Nettie, hardly. The
words were true of her,&mdash;"He that believeth
shall not make haste." She waited, looking
at him. Then he said, "What must I do,
Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
"How, child?"</p>

<p>"Father, the best way is to ask him, and
he will tell you how. If you are only willing
to be his servant&mdash;if you are willing to give
yourself to the Lord Jesus&mdash;are you willing,
father?"</p>

<p>"I am willing, anything!&mdash;if he will have
me," said Mr. Mathieson.</p>

<p>"Then go, father!" said Nettie, eagerly;&mdash;"go
and ask him, and he will teach you how;
he will, he has promised. Go, father, and ask
the Lord&mdash;will you? Go now."</p>

<p>Her father remained still a moment&mdash;then
he rose up and went out of the room, and she
heard his steps going up to the unused attic.
Nettie crossed her hands upon her breast, and
smiled. She was too much exhausted to
pray, otherwise than with a thought.</p>

<p>Her mother soon came in, and startled by
her flushed look, asked how she did.
"Well," Nettie said. Mrs. Mathieson was
uneasy, and brought her something to take,
which Nettie couldn't eat; and insisted on
her lying still and trying to go to sleep.
Nettie thought she could not sleep; and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
did not for some time; then slumber stole
over her, and she slept sweetly and quietly
while the hours of the summer afternoon
rolled away. Her mother watched beside her
for a long while before she awoke; and
during that time read surely in Nettie's
delicate cheek and too delicate colour, what
was the sentence of separation. She read it,
and smothered the cry of her heart, for
Nettie's sake.</p>

<p>The sun was descending toward the western
hilly country, and long level rays of light
were playing in the tree-tops, when Nettie
awoke.</p>

<p>"Are you there, mother?" she said&mdash;"and
is the Sunday so near over! How I have
slept."</p>

<p>"How do you feel, dear?"</p>

<p>"Why, I feel well," said Nettie. "It has
been a good day. The gold is all in the air
here&mdash;not in the streets." She had half
raised herself and was sitting looking out of
the window.</p>

<p>"Do you think of that city all the time?"
inquired Mrs. Mathieson, half jealously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
"Mother," said Nettie, slowly, still looking
out at the sunlight, "would you be very
sorry, and very much surprised, if I were to
go there before long?"</p>

<p>"I should not be very much surprised,
Nettie," answered her mother, in a tone that
told all the rest. Her child's eye turned to
her sorrowfully and understandingly.</p>

<p>"You'll not be very long before you'll
be there too," she said. "Now kiss me,
mother."</p>

<p>Could Mrs. Mathieson help it? She took
Nettie in her arms, but instead of the required
kiss there came a burst of passion
that bowed her head in convulsive grief
against her child's breast. The pent-up
sorrow, the great burden of love and tenderness,
the unspoken gratitude, the unspeakable
longing of heart, all came in those
tears and sobs that shook her as if she had
forgotten on what a frail support she was
half resting. Nay, nature must speak this
one time; she had taken the matter into her
own hands, and she was not to be struggled
with, for a while. Nettie bore it&mdash;how did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
she bear it? With a little trembling of lip
at first; then that passed, and with quiet
sorrow she saw and felt the suffering which
had broken forth so stormily. True to her
office, the little peacemaker tried her healing
art. Softly stroking her mother's face and head
while she spoke, she said very softly and slowly,</p>

<p>"Mother, you know it is Jesus that said,
'Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall
be comforted.' You have the mourning now,
but he will find the comfort by and by."</p>

<p>Ashamed of her giving way, and of her
having left it to the weak one to act the part
of the strong, Mrs. Mathieson checked herself,
held up her head and dried her tears. Nettie
lay down wearily.</p>

<p>"I will stay here, mother," she said, "till
tea is ready; and then I will come." Mrs.
Mathieson went to attend to it.</p>

<p>When Nettie went into the other room,
her father was sitting there. She said nothing
however, and even for some time did not look
in his face to see what he might have to say
to her. She took a cup of tea and a biscuit,
and eat an egg that her mother had boiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
for her. It was when supper was over, and
they had moved from the table and Mrs.
Mathieson was busy about, that Nettie turned
her eyes once more upon her father, with
their soft, full inquiry. He looked grave,
subdued, tender; she had heard that in his
voice already; not as she had ever seen him
look before. He met her eyes, and answered
them.</p>

<p>"I understand it now, Nettie," he said.</p>

<p>It was worth while to see Nettie's smile.
She was not a child very given to expressing
her feelings, and when pleasure reached that
point with her, it was something to see such
a breaking of light upon a face that generally
dwelt in twilight sobriety. Her father drew
her close, close within his arms; and without
one word Nettie sat there, till, for very happiness
and weariness, she fell asleep; and he
carried her to her room.</p>

<p>There was a great calm fell upon the family
for a little time thereafter. It was like one
of those spring days that were passed&mdash;full
of misty light, and peace, and hope, and
promise. It was a breath of rest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
But they knew it would end&mdash;for a time;
and one summer day the end came. It was
a Sunday again, and again Nettie was lying
on her bed, enjoying in her weakness the
loveliness of the air and beauty without.
Her mother was with her, and knew that she
had been failing very fast for some days.
Nettie knew it too.</p>

<p>"How soon do you think father will be
home?" she said.</p>

<p>"Not before another hour, I think," said
Mrs. Mathieson. "Why, what of it, Nettie?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;&mdash;" said Nettie, doubtfully.
"I'd like him to come."</p>

<p>"It wont be long," said her mother.</p>

<p>"Mother, I am going to give you my little
dear hymn book," said Nettie, presently;
"and I want to read you this hymn now,
and then you will think of me when you read
it. May I?"</p>

<p>"Read," said Mrs. Mathieson; and she
put up her hand to hide her face from Nettie.
Nettie did not look, however; her eyes were
on her hymn, and she read it, low and
sweetly&mdash;very sweetly&mdash;through. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
no tremor in her voice, but now and then a
little accent of joy or a shade of tenderness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mathieson's head bowed as the hymn
went on, but she dared not give way to tears,
and Nettie's manner half awed and half
charmed her into quietness. It was not likely
she would forget those words ever. When
the reading had ceased, and in a few minutes
Mrs. Mathieson felt that she could look
toward Nettie again, she saw that the book
had fallen from her hand and that she was
almost fainting. Alarmed instantly, she
called for help, and got one of the inmates
of the house to go after Mr. Mathieson. But
Nettie sank so fast, they were afraid he would
not come in time. The messenger came back
without having been able to find him; for
after the close of the services in the church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Mr. Mathieson had gone out of his way on
an errand of kindness. Nettie herself was
too low to ask for him, if indeed she was
conscious that he was not there. They could
not tell; she lay without taking any notice.</p>

<p>But just as the last rays of the sun were
bright in the leaves of the trees and on the
hills in the distance, Mr. Mathieson's step
was heard. One of the neighbours met him
and told him what he must expect; and
he came straight to Nettie's room. And
when he bent down over her and spoke,
Nettie knew his voice and opened her eyes,
and once more smiled. It was like a smile
from another country. Her eyes were fixed
on him. Mr. Mathieson bent yet nearer
and put his lips to hers; then he tried to
speak.</p>

<p>"My little peacemaker, what shall I do
without you?"</p>

<p>Nettie drew a long, long breath. "Peace&mdash;is&mdash;made,"
she slowly said.</p>

<p>And the peacemaker was gone.</p>
